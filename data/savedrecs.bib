Abstract = {{Many coastal and offshore fish species are highly dependent on specific
   habitat types for population maintenance. In the Baltic Sea, shallow
   productive habitats in the coastal zone such as wetlands, vegetated
   flads/lagoons and sheltered bays as well as more exposed rocky and sandy
   areas are utilized by fish across many life history stages including
   spawning, juvenile development, feeding and migration. Although there is
   general consensus about the critical importance of these essential fish
   habitats (EFH) for fish production along the coast, direct quantitative
   evidence for their specific roles in population growth and maintenance
   is still scarce. Nevertheless, for some coastal species, indirect
   evidence exists, and in many cases, sufficient data are also available
   to carry out further quantitative analyses. As coastal EFH in the Baltic
   Sea are often found in areas that are highly utilized and valued by
   humans, they are subjected to many different pressures. While cumulative
   pressures, such as eutrophication, coastal construction and development,
   climate change, invasive species and fisheries, impact fish in coastal
   areas, the conservation coverage for EFH in these areas remains poor.
   This is mainly due to the fact that historically, fisheries management
   and nature conservation are not integrated neither in research nor in
   management in Baltic Sea countries. Setting joint objectives for
   fisheries management and nature conservation would hence be pivotal for
   improved protection of EFH in the Baltic Sea. To properly inform
   management, improvements in the development of monitoring strategies and
   mapping methodology for EFH are also needed. Stronger international
   cooperation between Baltic Sea states will facilitate improved
   management outcomes across ecologically arbitrary boundaries. This is
   especially important for successful implementation of international
   agreements and legislative directives such as the Baltic Sea Action
   Plan, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Habitats Directive,
   and the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive, but also for improving the
   communication of information related to coastal EFH among researchers,
   stakeholders, managers and decision makers. In this paper, efforts are
   made to characterize coastal EFH in the Baltic Sea, their importance and
   the threats/pressures they face, as well as their current conservation
   status, while highlighting knowledge gaps and outlining perspectives for
   future work in an ecosystem-based management framework. (C) 2018

Title = {{On the reliability of the Elements of Metacommunity Structure framework
   for separating idealized metacommunity patterns}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{853-860}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The Elements of Metacommunity Structure (EMS) framework originally
   suggested by Leibold and Mikkelson (2002) in Oikos is a popular approach
   to identify idealized metacommunity patterns (i.e. checkerboard, nested,
   evenly spaced, Clementsian, Gleasonian), and hereby to infer the
   existence of structuring processes in meta communities. Essentially, the
   EMS framework consists of the rearrangement of the sites-by-species
   incidence matrix followed by a series of tests for coherence, turnover
   and boundary clumping in species distributions. Here, we give a critical
   evaluation of the EMS framework based on theoretical considerations and
   simulations. We found that user defined site ordering may influence the
   coherence test (number of embedded absences) depending also on the
   ordering of species, and therefore we argue that the application of
   user-defined matrix rearrangement has strong limitations. The
   recommended ordering by correspondence analysis is sensitive to matrix
   structure and may even include arbitrary decisions in special cases.
   Further, we revealed different meanings of the checkerboard pattern and
   showed that negative coherence is not necessarily associated with this
   as assumed in the EMS framework. Also, the turnover test cannot always
   detect nested pattern, because turnover and nestedness are not
   necessarily the opposite endpoints of a continuum. We argue that the
   boundary clumping test can only be used for separating Clementsian,
   Gleasonian and evenly spaced patterns if sites are ordered along a real
   environmental gradient rather than a latent one identified by
   correspondence analysis. We found that the series of tests in the EMS
   framework are burdened by anomalies and that the detection of some
   metacommunity patterns is sensitive to type II error. In sum, our
   findings suggest that the analytical methodology of the EMS framework,
   as well as the conclusions drawn from its application to metacommunity
   studies require careful reconsideration.}},

Title = {{Which breeding bird categories should we use in models of species
   distribution?}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{526-529}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Studies often use breeding bird atlases to assess species' habitat
   requirements or to estimate species' potential distribution under
   environmental changes. In breeding bird atlases, one of the attributes
   recorded for each grid square is evidence of breeding. The attribute
   represent probability of breeding (confirmed, probable, possible)
   categorized according to breeding behaviour. However, the majority of
   studies often make arbitrary decisions on which category to use. This
   may have severe consequences for results. This study evaluated whether
   models' discrimination ability change by inclusion of ambiguous breeding
   categories (probable, possible). We compared models' predictions for
   distribution of nine wetland birds derived from Atlas of the breeding
   distribution of birds in the Czech Republic. For each species, we
   developed generalized linear models using combinations of the breeding
   categories as input to model calibration and validation. Our results
   show that the discrimination ability (AUC) decreased in most cases when
   all breeding categories were uncritically used in calibration and
   validation process. On the other hand, however, inclusion of probable
   and possible breeding categories to model calibration did not affect
   models' abilities to predict confirmed presences and absences. This
   implies that inclusion of ambiguous breeding categories has more serious
   impact on models' performance when added to validation than to
   calibration data set. We advocate for more rigorous use of different
   breeding categories and emphasize that widely used atlases from citizen
   science programmes offer more than simple occurrence data. Additional
   attributes (e.g. breeding category, sampling effort) should be used to
   select high quality data to validate the models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{WIND ENERGY}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Because of the current shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable
   energy sources, it is necessary to plan for the installation of new
   infrastructure to meet the demand for clean energy. Traditional methods
   for determining wind turbine site suitability suffer from the selection
   of arbitrary criteria and model parameters by experts, which may lead to
   a degree of uncertainty in the models produced. An alternative
   empirically based methodology for building a wind turbine siting model
   for the state of Iowa is presented in the study. We employ ecological
   niche' principles traditionally utilized to model species allocation to
   develop a new multicriteria, spatially explicit framework for wind
   turbine placement. Using information on suitability conditions at
   existing turbine locations, we incorporate seven variables (wind speed,
   elevation, slope, land cover, distance of infrastructure and
   settlements, and population density) into two machine-learning
   algorithms {[}maximum entropy method (Maxent) and Genetic Algorithm for
   Rule Set Prediction (GARP)] to model suitable areas for installation of
   wind turbines. The performance of this method is tested at the statewide
   level and a six-county region in western Iowa. Maxent and GARP
   identified areas in the Northwest and North Central regions of Iowa as
   the optimum location for new wind turbines. Information on variable
   contributions from Maxent illuminates the relative importance of
   environmental variables and its scale-dependent nature. It also allows
   validating existing assumptions about the relationship between variables
   and wind turbine suitability. The resultant models demonstrate high
   levels of accuracy and suggest that the presented approach is a possible
   methodology for developing wind turbine siting applications. Copyright

Title = {{Selecting from correlated climate variables: a major source of
   uncertainty for predicting species distributions under climate change}},
Journal = {{ECOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{971-983}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Correlative species distribution models are frequently used to predict
   species' range shifts under climate change. However, climate variables
   often show high collinearity and most statistical approaches require the
   selection of one among strongly correlated variables. When causal
   relationships between species presence and climate parameters are
   unknown, variable selection is often arbitrary, or based on predictive
   performance under current conditions. While this should only marginally
   affect current range predictions, future distributions may vary
   considerably when climate parameters do not change in concert. We
   investigated this source of uncertainty using four highly correlated
   climate variables together with a constant set of landscape variables in
   order to predict current (2010) and future (2050) distributions of four
   mountain bird species in central Europe. Simulating different
   parameterization decisions, we generated a) four models including each
   of the climate variables singly, b) a model taking advantage of all
   variables simultaneously and c) an un-weighted average of the
   predictions of a). We compared model accuracy under current conditions,
   predicted distributions under four scenarios of climate change, and -
   for one species - evaluated back-projections using historical occurrence
   data. Although current and future variable-correlations remained
   constant, and the models' accuracy under contemporary conditions did not
   differ, future range predictions varied considerably in all climate
   change scenarios. Averaged models and models containing all climate
   variables simultaneously produced intermediate predictions; the latter,
   however, performed best in back-projections. This pattern, consistent
   across different modelling methods, indicates a benefit from including
   multiple climate predictors in ambiguous situations. Variable selection
   proved to be an important source of uncertainty for future range
   predictions, difficult to control using contemporary information. Small,
   but diverging changes of climate variables, masked by constant overall
   correlation patterns, can cause substantial differences between future
   range predictions which need to be accounted for, particularly when
   outcomes are intended for conservation decisions.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Lack of guidance for interpreting the definitions of endangered and
   threatened in the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) has resulted in
   case-by-case decision making leaving the process vulnerable to being
   considered arbitrary or capricious. Adopting quantitative decision rules
   would remedy this but requires the agency to specify the relative
   urgency concerning extinction events over time, cutoff risk values
   corresponding to different levels of protection, and the importance
   given to different types of listing errors. We tested the performance of
   3 sets of decision rules that use alternative functions for weighting
   the relative urgency of future extinction events: a threshold rule set,
   which uses a decision rule of x\% probability of extinction over y
   years; a concave rule set, where the relative importance of future
   extinction events declines exponentially over time; and a shoulder rule
   set that uses a sigmoid shape function, where relative importance
   declines slowly at first and then more rapidly. We obtained decision
   cutoffs by interviewing several biologists and then emulated the listing
   process with simulations that covered a range of extinction risks
   typical of ESA listing decisions. We evaluated performance of the
   decision rules under different data quantities and qualities on the
   basis of the relative importance of misclassification errors. Although
   there was little difference between the performance of alternative
   decision rules for correct listings, the distribution of
   misclassifications differed depending on the function used.
   Misclassifications for the threshold and concave listing criteria
   resulted in more overprotection errors, particularly as uncertainty
   increased, whereas errors for the shoulder listing criteria were more
   symmetrical. We developed and tested the framework for quantitative
   decision rules for listing species under the U.S. ESA. If policy values
   can be agreed on, use of this framework would improve the implementation
   of the ESA by increasing transparency and consistency.}},

Title = {{Choice of predictor variables as a source of uncertainty in
   continental-scale species distribution modelling under climate change}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Aim Species distribution modelling is commonly used to guide future
   conservation policies in the light of potential climate change. However,
   arbitrary decisions during the model-building process can affect
   predictions and contribute to uncertainty about where suitable climate
   space will exist. For many species, the key climatic factors limiting
   distributions are unknown. This paper assesses the uncertainty generated
   by using different climate predictor variable sets for modelling the
   impacts of climate change.
   Location Europe, 10 degrees W to 50 degrees E and 30 degrees N to 60
   degrees N.
   Methods Using 1453 presence pixels at 30 arcsec resolution for the great
   bustard (Otis tarda), predictions of future distribution were made based
   on two emissions scenarios, three general climate models and 26 sets of
   predictor variables. Twenty-six current models were created, and 156 for
   both 2050 and 2080. Map comparison techniques were used to compare
   predictions in terms of the quantity and the location of presences (map
   comparison kappa, MCK) and using a range change index (RCI). Generalized
   linear models (GLMs) were used to partition explained deviance in MCK
   and RCI among sources of uncertainty.
   Results The 26 different variable sets achieved high values of AUC (area
   under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and yet introduced
   substantial variation into maps of current distribution. Differences
   between maps were even greater when distributions were projected into
   the future. Some 64-78\% of the variation between future maps was
   attributable to choice of predictor variable set alone. Choice of
   general climate model and emissions scenario contributed a maximum of
   15\% variation and their order of importance differed for MCK and RCI.
   Main conclusions Generalized variable sets produce an unmanageable level
   of uncertainty in species distribution models which cannot be ignored.
   The use of sound ecological theory and statistical methods to check
   predictor variables can reduce this uncertainty, but our knowledge of
   species may be too limited to make more than arbitrary choices. When all
   sources of modelling uncertainty are considered together, it is doubtful
   whether ensemble methods offer an adequate solution. Future studies
   should explicitly acknowledge uncertainty due to arbitrary choices in
   the model-building process and develop ways to convey the results to
   decision-makers.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{There is concern about the potential impacts of climate change on
   species and ecosystems. To address this concern, a large body of
   literature has developed in which these impacts are assessed. In this
   study, criteria for conducting reliable and useful assessments of
   impacts of future climate are suggested. The major decisions involve:
   clearly defining an emissions scenario; selecting a climate model;
   evaluating climate model skill and bias; quantifying General Circulation
   Model (GCM) between-model variability; selecting an ecosystem model and
   assessing uncertainty; properly considering transient versus equilibrium
   responses; including effects of CO2 on plant response; evaluating
   implications of simplifying assumptions; and considering animal linkage
   with vegetation. A sample of the literature was surveyed in light of
   these criteria. Many of the studies used climate simulations that were
   >10 years old and not representative of best current models. Future
   effects of elevated CO2 on plant drought resistance and productivity
   were generally included in growth model studies but not in niche
   (habitat suitability) studies, causing the latter to forecast greater
   future adverse impacts. Overly simplified spatial representation was
   frequent and caused the existence of refugia to be underestimated. Few
   studies compared multiple climate simulations and ecosystem models
   (including parametric uncertainty), leading to a false impression of
   precision and potentially arbitrary results due to high between-model
   variance. No study assessed climate model retrodictive skill or bias.
   Overall, most current studies fail to meet all of the proposed criteria.
   Suggestions for improving assessments are provided.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{89}},

Pages = {{3371-3386}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Sophisticated statistical analyses are common in ecological research,
   particularly in species distribution modeling. The effects of sometimes
   arbitrary decisions during the modeling procedure on the final outcome
   are difficult to assess, and to date are largely unexplored. We
   conducted an analysis quantifying the contribution of uncertainty in
   each step during the model-building sequence to variation in model
   validity and climate change projection uncertainty. Our study system was
   the distribution of the Great Grey Shrike in the German federal state of
   Saxony. For each of four steps (data quality, collinearity method, model
   type, and variable selection), we ran three different options in a
   factorial experiment, leading to 81 different model approaches. Each was
   subjected to a fivefold cross-validation, measuring area under curve
   (AUC) to assess model quality. Next, we used three climate change
   scenarios times three precipitation realizations to project future
   distributions from each model, yielding 729 projections. Again, we
   analyzed which step introduced most variability (the four model-building
   steps plus the two scenario steps) into predicted species prevalences by
   the year 2050. Predicted prevalences ranged from a factor of 0.2 to a
   factor of 10 of present prevalence, with the majority of predictions
   between 1.1 and 4.2 (inter-quartile range). We found that model type and
   data quality dominated this analysis. In particular, artificial neural
   networks yielded low cross-validation robustness and gave very
   conservative climate change predictions. Generalized linear and additive
   models were very similar in quality and predictions, and superior to
   neural networks. Variations in scenarios and realizations had very
   little effect, due to the small spatial extent of the study region and
   its relatively small range of climatic conditions. We conclude that, for
   climate projections, model type and data quality were the most
   influential factors. Since comparison of model types has received good
   coverage in the ecological literature, effects of data quality should
   now come under more scrutiny.}},

Abstract = {{The paucity of empirical data on processes in species life cycles
   demands tools to extract insight from field observations. Such insights
   help inform policy on invasive species and on impacts of climate change
   at regional and local scales. We used the CLIMEX model to infer the
   response of the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren
   (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), to temperature and moisture from its range in
   the United States. We tested hypotheses on the mechanisms that limit the
   distribution of the ant and estimated the potential global area at risk
   from invasion. The ant can spread further in the United States,
   including north along the west coast, where patterns of infestation will
   differ from those in the east. We analyzed the risk of colonization in
   Australia and New Zealand, where the ant was recently discovered. The
   patterns of infestation of the ant in Oceania will differ from those in
   the eastern United States, with slower growth and less winter mortality.
   This study adds to earlier temperature-based models by incorporating a
   moisture response; by replacing arbitrary categories of colony size to
   predict overwintering success with a site-specific model based on the
   balance between annual growth and survival; and by comparing different
   hypotheses on low temperature-related mechanisms that limit the
   geographical distribution. It shows how the response of a species to
   climate can be synthesized from field observations to provide useful
   insights into its population dynamics. Such analyses provide a basis for
   making decisions on regional management of invasive species and an
   informative context for local studies.}},
