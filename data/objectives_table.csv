1,"Review of reproducibility and meta-research literature, & reproducibility research in ecology and conservaiton",,Identify major knowledge gaps in reproducibility for  in ecology and conservation decision-making and establish rationale for thesis,Literature Review,Identify thesis research aims and studies / chapters addressing aims,,
2,Defining a Typology for reproducibility of decision support systems in conservation and ecology,How do we measure the reproducibility of a DSS? What are the epistemic functions of reproducibility for DSS's?,Provide standardised terminology and conceptual framework for understanding reproducibility useful for decision-support in ecology and conservation ,Literature Review + collaborative workshop?,Synthesise a typology of reproducibilty defining the conditions and epistemic functions of different types of reproducibility. The typology will facilitate a standardised way of conducting replications.,,
3,Questionable Research Practices for non-hypothesis testing research in ecology and conservation decision-making,Causes and solutions of crisis are NHST focussed. Lack of a conceptual framework for QRPs in non-NHST research.,Identify potential QRPs for three common modelling methods. Estimate their prevalence.,Literature Review + Survey,1.  QRP roadmaps for each modelling approach 2. Empirical evidence demonstrating prevalence of important QRPs 3. Qualitative evidence illustrating context-specific exceptions to QRPs,,
4,Systematic Review of Transparency in Reporting Practices in Ecology and Conservation,Does Eco/ConsDM have a reproducibility problem? Response to Fidler et al. (2017)â€™s call for assessment of completeness and transparency of methodological and statistical reporting in ecology journals. Extend to decision-making problems for EcoCons.,"Using the outputs of chapter 3, evaluate the likely reproducibility of each of the three modelling types. Identify critical aspects of reporting practices that are deficient.",Systematic Review,Empirical evidence about the state of transparency in ecological modelling for decision-support. Expected output:  inform checklist of items,,
5,Case Study,No appropriate strategies or solutions available for non-NHST research methods,Develop and demonstrate through a case study best-practice strategies for improving transparency and reproducibility,Modelling and expert elicitation,,,
