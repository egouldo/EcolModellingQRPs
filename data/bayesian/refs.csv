Conflicts are associated with impacts of existing and planned projects on wildlife, and associated difficulties of prediction where impacts are subject to considerable uncertainty. Many post-construction studies have demonstrated adverse effects on individuals of various bird and bat species. These effects may come in the form of collision-induced mortality or behavioral or physiological changes reducing the fitness of individuals exposed to wind energy facilities. Upscaling these individual effects to population impacts provides information on the true value of interest from a conservation point of view. This paper identifies methodological issues associated when moving from individual effects to population impacts in the context of wind energy. Distinct methodological approaches to predict population impacts are described using published case studies. The various choices of study design and metrics available to detect significant changes at the population level are further assessed based on these. Ways to derive impact thresholds relevant for decision-making are discussed in detail. Robust monitoring schemes and sophisticated modelling techniques may inevitably be unable to describe the whole complexity of wind and wildlife interactions and the natural variability of animal populations. Still, they will provide an improved understanding of the response of wildlife to wind energy and better-informed policies to support risk-based decision-making. Policies that support the use of adaptive management will promote assessments at the population level. Providing information to adequately balance the development of wind energy with the persistence of wildlife populations.","MAYBE"

However, conventional statistical PVA requires long-term data from every population of interest, whereas many species of concern exist in multiple isolated populations that are only monitored occasionally. We present a hierarchical multi-population viability analysis model that increases inference power from sparse data by sharing information among populations to assess extinction risks while accounting for incomplete detection and sampling biases with explicit observation and sampling sub-models. We present a case study in which we customized this model for historical population monitoring data (1985-2015) from federally threatened Lahontan cutthroat trout populations in the Great Basin, USA. Data were counts of fish captured during backpack electrofishing surveys from locations associated with 155 isolated populations. Some surveys (25%) included multi-pass removal sampling, which provided valuable information about capture efficiency. GIS and remote sensing were used to estimate August stream temperatures, peak flows, and riparian vegetation condition in each population each year. Field data were used to derive an annual index of nonnative trout densities. Results indicated that population growth rates were higher in colder streams and that nonnative trout reduced carrying capacities of native trout. Extinction risks increased with more environmental stochasticity and were also related to population extent, water temperatures, and nonnative densities. We developed a graphical user interface to interact with the fitted model results and to simulate future habitat scenarios and management actions to assess their influence on extinction risks in each population. Hierarchical multi-population viability analysis bridges the gap between site-level field observations and population-level processes, making effective use of existing datasets to support management decisions with robust estimates of population dynamics, extinction risks, and uncertainties.","MAYBE"

Regression-theory influence diagnostics identify influential data by combining the leverage and the standardised residuals, and are computationally more efficient than case-deletion approaches. This study evaluates the performance of a range of regression-theory influence diagnostics on ten case studies with a variety of model structures and inference scenarios including: nonlinear model response, heteroscedastic residual errors, data uncertainty and Bayesian priors. A new technique is developed, generalised Cook's distance, that is able to accurately identify the same influential data as standard case deletion approaches ( Spearman rank correlation: 0.93-1.00) at a fraction of the computational cost (<1%). This is because generalised Cook's distance uses a generalised leverage formulation which outperforms linear and nonlinear leverage formulations due to less restrictive assumptions. Generalised Cook's distance has the potential to enable influential data to be efficiently identified on a wide variety of hydrological and environmental modelling problems. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Since there is no common unit of observation, the significance of the relationships is tested using a double permutation procedure (site based and species based). This method implies that all species and sites are independent of each other. However, this fundamental hypothesis might be flawed because of phylogenetic relatedness between species and spatial autocorrelation in the environmental data. Here, using a simulation-based experiment, we demonstrate how the presence of spatial and phylogenetic autocorrelations can, in some circumstances, lead to inflated type I error rates, suggesting that significant associations can be misidentified. As an alternative, we propose a new randomization approach designed to avoid this issue, based on Moran's spectral randomization. In this approach, standard permutations are replaced by constrained randomizations so that the distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis is built with additional constraints to preserve the phylogenetic and spatial structures of the observed data. The inclusion of this new randomization approach provides total control over type I error rates and should be used in real studies where spatial and phylogenetic autocorrelations often occur.","NO"

These developments have allowed investigators to separately assess individual and group effects on true survival, site fidelity, and temporary emigration. Additionally, recent advances in the BUGS language have allowed researchers to develop increasingly complex, user-specified models in Bayesian frameworks. The robust design has rarely been implemented in the BUGS language, and previous attempts to parameterize the robust design in BUGS exhibited strong bias in estimates of temporary emigration rates. Given the limitations of current parameterizations of the robust design in Bayesian frameworks, and our research objectives, we have developed a parameterization of the robust design in the BUGS language that produces unbiased estimates of all model parameters. We use this novel model structure to examine lifetime carry-over effects of environmental conditions during early life on annual breeding probabilities of Pacific black brent Branta bernicla nigricans breeding on the Yukon-Kuskokwim River Delta in Western Alaska. We found that individuals that were more structurally developed as goslings bred at increased rates as adults (beta = 0.14, f = 0.94), with no effect on adult survival (beta = 0.01, f = 0.62). Additionally, we provide evidence for long-term declines in apparent survival of breeding adult females at the population level (beta = -0.01, f = 0.90). This novel model structure can be easily expanded (Gibson et al., in press) and has important implications for population modelling at broad scales, where we apply it to a declining population of Pacific black brent. Given long-term declines in gosling growth on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, we predict future declines in population trajectories as a result of lifetime carry-over effects of environmental conditions during growth on adult fecundity and long-term declines in adult survival.","YES"

Remote cameras have become a promising, cost-effective tool for monitoring wildlife populations. Yet, for species where individuals are indistinguishable, remote cameras' ability to provide robust and precise density estimates has been limited without the use of invasive marking. 2. Using the American black bear as a model species, we evaluated methods for estimating wildlife densities using remote camera detections of unmarked individuals against estimates from spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models using individual detections. We also tested the effect of incorporating varying proportions of marked individuals on model accuracy and precision. 3. Spatial count (SC) models using unmarked individuals produced estimates of bear density within 0.6% of those from SCR. We extended SC models to incorporate variation in density as a function of land use/land cover, and identified identical relationships between variation in bear densities and housing density as obtained using SCR. Incorporating individual detection data from simultaneous non-invasive genetic sampling lead to more precise, but biased estimates. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results identify contexts in which camera count data can be used as an alternative to spatial capture-recapture (SCR) when individual identification is prohibitive. Spatial count models provided an accurate, but less precise replication of spatial capture-recapture density estimates and may provide consistent insights into spatial variation in density. Mixed samples of camera counts and auxiliary individual detections are likely to be of limited use, but fitting spatial count models to populations with partial visual markings could improve their precision.","NO"

This approach combines the Least Squares (LS) technique for calibrating hydrological model parameters with a simple method-of-moments (MoM) estimator of error model parameters (here, the variance and lag-1 autocorrelation of residual errors). A case study using two conceptual hydrological models shows that the LS-MoM approach achieves probabilistic predictions with similar predictive performance to classical maximum-likelihood and Bayesian approaches-but is simpler to implement using common hydrological software and has a lower computational cost.

This was done by combining the best available information from observations and chemical transport models. Specifically, by (1) incorporating PM10 surface daily concentrations and model results from the CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service) ensemble; and (2) spreading the forecast corrections from the observation locations to the entire gridded domain covered by model forecasts by means of a data regularization approach. Results were verified against independent PM10 observations measured at 169 stations by local Environmental Protection Agencies. Twelve months of observations were matched in time and space, from January to December 2017, with air pollution model results. The studied domain encompassed the Po Valley, one of the most polluted areas in Europe, and that still does not meet the air quality criteria for the annual average concentration and the maximum number of exceedances allowed for the particulate matter. Raw model data were found to be affected by a bias with a strong seasonal dependency: a large negative bias in winter and a small bias in the summer months. The data assimilation approach, embedded into a Bayesian hierarchical approach, was able to drastically reduce the bias. Furthermore, an advanced computational approach, based on the variational Bayes method coupled with the minimization of the Kullback Leibler divergence to approximate the optimal solution, made it possible to cost-effectively assimilate data throughout the period under consideration. By using stratified cross-validation to test the accuracy of our predictions, we found high out-of-sample R-2 ( = 0.83) and an average decrease of about two-thirds of the root mean square error. Assimilated data were used to produce daily resolved cumulative population exposures. The Po Valley, in relation to the interim targets (ITs) defined by the World Health Organization, accomplishes the IT-2 level, that is to say that the average annual concentration is lower than 50 mu g/m(3), but it is still very far from the IT-3 level, corresponding to an average annual concentration of less than 30 mu g/m(3). Moreover, most of the Po Valley still has a high number of days in which the average daily concentration is higher than 50 mu g/m(3), well above the maximum limit of 35 days established by European and Italian legislation. Our results demonstrate that PM10 can be reproduced reliably using this assimilation approach, combining different sources of information, so as to perform a thorough diagnosis of air quality over a spatially and temporally uniform area.","NO"

Binomial N-mixture models are commonly applied to analyse population survey data. By estimating detection probabilities, N-mixture models aim at extracting information about abundances in terms of absolute and not just relative numbers. This separation of detection probability and abundance relies on parametric assumptions about the distribution of individuals among sites and of detections of individuals among repeat visits to sites. Current methods for checking assumptions are limited, and their computational complexity has hindered evaluations of their performance. 2. We use simulations and a case study to assess the sensitivity of binomial N-mixture models to overdispersion in abundance and in detection, develop computationally efficient graphical goodness of fit checks to detect it, and evaluate the ability of the checks to identify overdispersion. 3. The simulations show that if the parametric assumptions are not exact the bias in estimated abundances can be severe: underestimation if there is overdispersion in abundance relative to the fitted model and overestimation if there is overdispersion in detection. Our goodness-of-fit checks performed well in detecting lack of fit when the abundance distribution was overdispersed, but struggled to detect lack of fit when detections were overdispersed. We show that the inability to detect lack of fit due to overdispersed detection is caused by a fundamental similarity between N-mixture models with beta-binomial detections and N-mixture models with negative binomial abundances. 4. The strong biases that can occur in the binomial N-mixture model when the distribution of individuals among sites, or the detection model, is mis-specified implies that checking goodness of fit is essential for sound inference about abundance. To check the assumptions we provide computationally efficient goodness of fit checks that are available in an R-package nmixgof. However, even when a binomial N-mixture model appears to fit the data well, estimates are not robust in the presence of overdispersion. We show that problems can occur even when estimated detection probabilities are high, and that previously reported problems with negative binomial models cannot always be diagnosed by checking the sensitivity of abundance estimates to numerical cutoff values used in likelihood computations.","YES"

First, BBNs subsume thousands of predictions to provide probabilistic outcomes. Second, by using prior probabilities, a practitioner can still obtain predictions of wave outcomes even when their knowledge of input parameters is incomplete.

However, the question of how imperfect detection of species affects estimates of functional and phylogenetic community structure remains untested. We used long-term counts of breeding bird species that were detected at least once on islands in a land-bridge island system, and employed multi-species occupancy models to assess the effects of imperfect detection of species on estimates of bird diversity and community structure by incorporating species traits and phylogenies. Our results showed that taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity were all underestimated significantly as a result of species' imperfect detection, with taxonomic diversity showing the greatest bias. The functional and phylogenetic structure calculated from observed communities were both more clustered than those from the detection-corrected communities due to missed distinct species. The discrepancy between observed and estimated diversity differed according to the measure of biodiversity employed. Our study demonstrates the importance of accounting for species' imperfect detection in biodiversity studies, especially for functional and phylogenetic community ecology, and when attempting to infer community assembly processes. With datasets that allow for detection-corrected community structure, we can better estimate diversity and infer the underlying mechanisms that structure community assembly, and thus make reliable management decisions for the conservation of biodiversity.","MAYBE"

Opportunistically collected species observations contributed by volunteer reporters are increasingly available for species and regions for which systematically collected data are not available. However, it is unclear if they are suitable to produce reliable habitat suitability models (HSMs), and hence if the species-habitat relationships found and habitat suitability maps produced can be used with confidence to advice conservation management and address basic and applied research questions. 2. We evaluated HSMs with opportunistically collected observations against HSMs with systematically collected observations. We enhanced the opportunistically collected presence-only data by adding inferred species absences. To obtain inferred absences, we asked individual reporters about their identification skills and if they reported certain species consistently and combined this information with their observations. We evaluated several HSM methods using a forest bird species, Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus), in Sweden: logistic regression with inferred absences, two versions of MaxEnt, a model combining presence-absence with presence-only observations and a Bayesian site-occupancy-detection model. 3. All HSM methods produced nationwide habitat suitability maps of Siberian jay that agreed well with systematically collected observations (AUC: 086-0.88) and were very similar to a habitat suitability map produced from the HSM with systematically collected observations (Spearman rho: 0.94-0.98). At finer geographical scales there were differences among methods. 4. At finer scale, the resulting habitat suitability maps from logistic regression with inferred absences agreed better with results from systematically collected observations than other methods. The species-habitat relationships found with logistic regression also agreed well with those found from systematically collected data and with prior expectations based on the species ecology. 5. Synthesis and application. For many regions and species, systematically collected data are not available. By using inferred absences from high-quality, opportunistically collected contributions of few very active reporters in logistic regression we obtained HSMs that produced results similar to those from a systematic survey. Adding high-quality inferred absences to opportunistically collected data is likely possible for many less common species across various organism groups. Well-performing HSMs are important to facilitate applications such as spatial conservation planning and prioritization, monitoring of invasive species, understanding species habitat requirements or climate change studies.","NO"

Animals often exhibit changes in their behaviour during migration. Telemetry data provide a way to observe geographic position of animals over time, but not necessarily changes in the dynamics of the movement process. Continuous-time models allow for statistical predictions of the trajectory in the presence of measurement error and during periods when the telemetry device did not record the animal's position. However, continuous-time models capable of mimicking realistic trajectories with sufficient detail are computationally challenging to fit to large datasets. Furthermore, basic continuous-time model specifications (e.g. Brownian motion) lack realism in their ability to capture nonstationary dynamics. 2. We present a unified class of animal movement models that are computationally efficient and provide a suite of approaches for accommodating nonstationarity in continuous trajectories due to migration and interactions among individuals. Our approach uses process convolutions to allow for flexibility in the movement process while facilitating implementation and incorporating location uncertainty. We show how to nest convolution models to incorporate interactions among migrating individuals to account for nonstationarity and provide inference about dynamic migratory networks. 3. We demonstrate these approaches in two case studies involving migratory birds. Specifically, we used process convolution models with temporal deformation to account for heterogeneity in individual greater white-fronted goose migrations in Europe and Iceland, and we used nested process convolutions to model dynamic migratory networks in sandhill cranes in North America. 4. The approach we present accounts for various forms of temporal heterogeneity in animal movement and is not limited to migratory applications. Furthermore, our models rely on well-established principles for modelling-dependent data and leverage modern approaches for modelling dynamic networks to help explain animal movement and social interaction.","NO"

We consider the effects of three violations of assumptions that might reasonably be expected in practice: double counting, unmodeled variation in population size over time, and unmodeled variation in detection probability over time. These three examples show that small violations of assumptions can lead to large biases in estimation. The violations of assumptions we consider are not only small qualitatively, but are also small in the sense that they are unlikely to be detected using goodness-of-fit tests. In cases where reliable estimates of population size are needed, we encourage investigators to allocate resources to acquiring additional data, such as recaptures of marked individuals, for estimation of detection probabilities.","YES"

Despite its popularity and substantial history, the value of the umbrella species concept has come into question because umbrella species chosen using heuristic methods, such as body or home range size, are not acting as adequate proxies for the metrics of interest: species richness or population abundance in a multi-species community for which protection is sought. How species associate with habitat across ecological scales has important implications for understanding population size and species richness, and therefore may be a better proxy for choosing an umbrella species. We determined the spatial scales of ecological neighborhoods important for predicting abundance of 8 potential umbrella species breeding in Nebraska using Bayesian latent indicator scale selection in N-mixture models accounting for imperfect detection. We compare the conservation value measured as collective avian abundance under different umbrella species selected following commonly used criteria and selected based on identifying spatial land cover characteristics within ecological neighborhoods that maximize collective abundance. Using traditional criteria to select an umbrella species resulted in sub-maximal expected collective abundance in 86% of cases compared to selecting an umbrella species based on land cover characteristics that maximized collective abundance directly. We conclude that directly assessing the expected quantitative outcomes, rather than ecological proxies, is likely the most efficient method to maximize the potential for conservation success under the umbrella species concept.","MAYBE"

Traditional surveys used to create species distribution maps and estimate ecological relationships are expensive and time consuming.

In this paper, we investigate the use of auxiliary (e.g. citizen science) data as a guide to designing more efficient ecological surveys. Our aim is to explore the use of opportunistic data to inform spatial survey design through a novel objective function that minimizes misclassificaton rate (i.e. false positives and false negatives) of the estimated occupancy maps. We use an initial occupancy estimate from auxiliary data as the prior in a Bayesian spatial occupancy model, and an efficient posterior approximation that accounts for spatial dependence, covariate effects, and imperfect detection in an exchange algorithm to search for the optimal set of sampling locations to minimize misclassification rate. 3. We examine the optimal design as a function of the detection rate and quality of the citizen-science data, and compare this optimal design with several common ad hoc designs via an extensive simulation study.

Model-based distance sampling is commonly used to understand spatial variation in the density of wildlife species. The standard approach assumes that individuals are distributed uniformly and models spatial variation in density using plot-level effects. Thinned point process (TPP) models for surveys of unmarked populations (spatial distance sampling) better leverage the spatial information underlying individual encounters, and in the presence of within-plot variation in density, may explain a larger proportion of the spatial variation in density. However, existing spatial distance sampling approaches are conditioned on the assumption that all individuals are present and available for sampling. Temporary emigration of individuals can therefore result in biased estimates of abundance. 2. We extended spatial distance sampling models to accommodate temporary emigration (TPP model). Using simulations of a thinned inhomogeneous point process, we assessed the performance of the TPP model relative to the temporary emigration distance sampling (TEDS) model, which implies a uniform distribution of individuals. In addition, we compared inferences between TPP and TEDS models using data for two passerine species in Alaska. 3. Parameter estimates from the TPP model exhibited improved coverage probability and precision relative to the TEDS model including a 26% reduction in the coefficient of variation (CV) of the population size estimate. 4. In the applied example, the TEDS model indicated weak relationships between abundance and habitat covariates, whereas the TPP model indicated strong relationships for those same effects, suggesting that spatial distance sampling models can provide considerably stronger inference in the presence of within-plot variation in density. In addition, the CV of the population size estimates for the two passerine species were 32% and 4% smaller under the TPP model. 5. Synthesis and applications. We expect our extension accommodating temporary emigration will be a critical specification for spatial distance sampling models, particularly for studies assessing changes in the distribution and abundance of highly mobile species including passerines.","NO"

Estimating abundance with ground-based census methods have practical advantages, but it can be difficult to simultaneously account for temporary emigration and observer error to avoid biased results. Contemporary research in population ecology increasingly relies on telemetry observations of the states and locations of individuals to gain insight on vital rates, animal movements, and population abundance. Analytical models that use observations of movements to improve estimates of abundance have not been developed. Here we build upon existing multi-state mark-recapture methods using a hierarchical N-mixture model with multiple sources of data, including telemetry data on locations of individuals, to improve estimates of population sizes. We used a state-space approach to model animal movements to approximate the number of marked animals present within the study area at any observation period, thereby accounting for a frequently changing number of marked individuals. We illustrate the approach using data on a population of elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) in Northern Colorado, USA. We demonstrate substantial improvement compared to existing abundance estimation methods and corroborate our results from the ground based surveys with estimates from aerial surveys during the same seasons. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian N-mixture model using multiple sources of data on abundance, movement and survival to estimate the population size of a mobile species that uses remote conservation areas. The model improves accuracy of inference relative to previous methods for estimating abundance of open populations.","YES"

Mortality and recruitment rates are fundamental measures of population dynamics. Ecologists and others have defined and estimated these vital rates in various ways. We review these alternatives focusing on tree population census data in fixed area plots, though many aspects have wider application when similar data characteristics and assumptions apply: our goal is to guide choices and facilitate comparisons. 2. We divide our estimates into instantaneous and annual rates, corresponding to continuous or discrete time dynamics, respectively. In each case, vital rate estimates can be further divided into those based on population density (per-capita rates) and those based on census area (per-area rates). We also examine how all such rate estimates relate to each other and can thus be interconverted and compared. 3. In a heterogeneous population (e.g. trees in a forest stand) comprising subpopulations (e.g. species, locations, exposure classes), estimates of vital rates that assume homogeneity (equal likelihood of mortality and equal likelihood of recruitment for all individuals) are biased towards lower vital rates in stable mixed populations (due to survivorship bias) and towards lower absolute values of population change rate (due to changing-frequency bias). 4. We describe and illustrate an individual-based Bayesian procedure for estimating vital rates that reduces biases by accounting for demographic heterogeneity and sampling errors among and within subpopulations.","MAYBE"

Several new growth models have been proposed to account for the life-history trade-offs that occur when indeterminately growing species allocate energy between somatic growth and reproduction. These models can improve the understanding of lifetime growth and life history, but can be more difficult to fit than conventional growth models. Increased data demands, multiple growth phases and increased parameterization all serve as barriers to the adoption and proper use of these new models. 2. We review and comment on confounding issues during model fitting for several of these models, and provide advice on surmounting such issues. We then simulation-test an example model, the Lester biphasic growth model, using several common fitting approaches. We highlight the biases and precision of each approach and provide guiding documents using r and jags code. 3. The Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo and likelihood profiling approaches generally provided the best fits. Simpler approaches can be unbiased and precise if sampled data are of relatively high quality (e.g. moderate sample sizes for juvenile and adult phases) and model assumptions are met. Bayesian hierarchical approaches can accommodate more complicated data scenarios (e.g. unbalanced design across multiple populations); we provide an example of such an approach by recovering growth trajectories and inferring growth-associated trait variation and environmental effects across multiple populations. 4. Conventional growth models provide limited inference on life history. Many biphasic growth models can provide direct inference on multiple life-history traits, but can be difficult to fit. The recommended approaches herein provide a path forward for fitting biphasic growth models in a variety of scenarios, allowing for wider application and tests of life history and ecological theory.","MAYBE"

In many cases, however, evidence linking introduced species to native declines is weak. Failure to make strong inferences regarding the role of introduced species can hamper attempts to predict population viability and delay effective management responses. For many species, mark-recapture analysis is the more rigorous form of demographic analysis. However, to our knowledge, there are no mark-recapture models that allow for joint modeling of interacting species. Here, we introduce a two-species mark-recapture population model in which the vital rates (and capture probabilities) of one species are allowed to vary in response to the abundance of the other species. We use a simulation study to explore bias and choose an approach to model selection. We then use the model to investigate species interactions between endangered humpback chub (Gila cypha) and introduced rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the Colorado River between 2009 and 2016. In particular, we test hypotheses about how two environmental factors (turbidity and temperature), intraspecific density dependence, and rainbow trout abundance are related to survival, growth, and capture of juvenile humpback chub. We also project the long-term effects of different rainbow trout abundances on adult humpback chub abundances. Our simulation study suggests this approach has minimal bias under potentially challenging circumstances (i.e., low capture probabilities) that characterized our application and that model selection using indicator variables could reliably identify the true generating model even when process error was high. When the model was applied to rainbow trout and humpback chub, we identified negative relationships between rainbow trout abundance and the survival, growth, and capture probability of juvenile humpback chub. Effects on interspecific interactions on survival and capture probability were strongly supported, whereas support for the growth effect was weaker. Environmental factors were also identified to be important and in many cases stronger than interspecific interactions, and there was still substantial unexplained variation in growth and survival rates. The general approach presented here for combining mark-recapture data for two species is applicable in many other systems and could be modified to model abundance of the invader via other modeling approaches.","MAYBE"

Here we offer one avenue to do all of the above using a hierarchical Bayesian approach. We estimate posterior distributions of the underlying true relative abundances of each species within each unit sampled. These posterior estimates of relative abundance can then be used with existing formulae to estimate and partition diversity. The result is a posterior distribution of diversity metrics describing our knowledge (or beliefs) about the study system. This approach intuitively leads to statistical inferences addressing biologically motivated hypotheses via Bayesian model comparison. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our approach does as well or better at approximating the true diversity of a community relative to naive or ad-hoc bias-corrected estimates. Moreover, model comparison correctly distinguishes between alternative hypotheses about the distribution of diversity within and among samples.

An effort to estimate abundance via a repeated mark-recapture experiment may fail to recapture marked individuals. We devised a method for obtaining lower bounds on abundance in the absence of recaptures for both panmictic and spatially structured populations. The method assumes few enough recaptures were expected to be missed by random chance. The upper Bayesian credible limit on expected recaptures allows probabilistic statements about the minimum number of individuals present in the population. We applied this method to data from a 12-year survey of pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) in the lower and middle Mississippi River (U.S.A.). None of the 241 individuals marked was recaptured in the survey. After accounting for survival and movement, our model-averaged estimate of the total abundance of pallid sturgeon >= 3 years old in the study area had a 1%, 5%, or 25% chance of being <4,600, 7,000, or 15,000, respectively. When we assumed fish were distributed in proportion to survey catch per unit effort, the farthest downstream reach in the survey hosted at least 4.5-15 fish per river kilometer (rkm), whereas the remainder of the reaches in the lower and middle Mississippi River hosted at least 2.6-8.5 fish/rkm for all model variations examined. The lower Mississippi River had an average density of pallid sturgeon >= 3 years old of at least 3.0-9.8 fish/rkm.

However, low concentrations make sediment DNA difficult to detect, leading to high false negative rates. Additionally, contamination could potentially lead to high false positive rates. Careful laboratory procedures can reduce false positive and negative rates, but should not be assumed to completely eliminate them. Therefore, methods are needed that identify potential false positive and negative results, and use this information to judge the plausibility of different interpretations of DNA data from natural archives. We developed a Bayesian algorithm to infer the colonization history of a species using records of DNA from lake-sediment cores, explicitly labelling some observations as false positive or false negative. We illustrate the method by analysing DNA of whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus L.) from sediment cores covering the past 10,000years from two central Swedish lakes. We provide the algorithm as an R-script, and the data from this study as example input files. In one lake, Stora Logdasjon, where connectivity with the proto-Baltic Sea and the degree of whitefish ecotype differentiation suggested colonization immediately after deglaciation, DNA was indeed successfully recovered and amplified throughout the post-glacial sediment. For this lake, we found no loss of detection probability over time, but a high false negative rate. In the other lake, Hotagen, where connectivity and ecotype differentiation suggested colonization long after deglaciation, DNA was amplified only in the upper part of the sediment, and colonization was estimated at 2,200bp based on the assumption that successful amplicons represent whitefish presence. Here the earliest amplification represents a false positive with a posterior probability of 41%, which increases the uncertainty in the estimated time of colonization. Complementing careful laboratory procedures aimed at preventing contamination, our method estimates contamination rates from the data. By combining these results with estimates of false negative rates, our models facilitate unbiased interpretation of data from natural DNA archives.","NO"

Evaluating range-wide habitat use by a target species requires information on species occurrence over broad geographic regions, a process made difficult by species rarity, large spatiotemporal sampling domains and imperfect detection. We address these challenges in an assessment of habitat use for jaguars (Panthera onca) outside protected areas in Central America. 2. Occurrence records were acquired within 12 putative corridors using interviews with knowledgeable corridor residents. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical occupancy model to gain robust inference, allowing for heterogeneity introduced in the sampling process over space and time, using records of jaguar occurrence prone to false positives and false negatives. 3. Probability of false detection of jaguars increased with the number of interviews conducted per unit (from 5.42% to 7.74% given <4 and >= 4 observers per unit). True probability of detection (p=0.58) increased with the number of days interviewees spent in a survey unit per year. Failing to account for false positives biased predicted habitat use high (c. 1.8x), especially where occurrence records were sparse. 4. Probability of site use by jaguars increased with greater forest cover, prey richness, and distance from human settlements, and decreased with greater agricultural cover, elevation, and distance from protected areas. Site use probabilities averaged 0.15-0.97 by corridor, providing relatively fine-scale resolution of predicted jaguar occurrence consistent with known patterns of jaguar gene flow across Central America. 5. Model validation, accounting for both false positives and negatives in the observation process, indicated moderate correspondence between model-predicted observations and actual observations for withheld data (0.65, 95% CRI 0.59-0.71), with sensitivity and specificity rates of 0.69 (0.61-0.77) and 0.59 (0.50-0.68), respectively.

Conservation managers rely on accurate estimates of disease parameters, such as pathogen prevalence and infection intensity, to assess disease status of a host population. However, these disease metrics may be biased if low-level infection intensities are missed by sampling methods or laboratory diagnostic tests. These false negatives underestimate pathogen prevalence and overestimate mean infection intensity of infected individuals. 2. Our objectives were two-fold. First, we quantified false negative error rates of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) on non-invasive skin swabs collected from an amphibian community in El Cope, Panama. We swabbed amphibians twice in sequence, and we used a recently developed hierarchical Bayesian estimator to assess disease status of the population. Second, we developed a novel hierarchical Bayesian model to simultaneously account for imperfect pathogen detection from field sampling and laboratory diagnostic testing. We evaluated the performance of the model, using simulations and varying sampling design to quantify the magnitude of bias in estimates of pathogen prevalence and infection intensity. 3. We show that Bd detection probability from skin swabs was related to host infection intensity, where Bd infections <10 zoospores have <95% probability of being detected. If imperfect Bd detection was not considered, then Bd prevalence was underestimated by as much as 71%. In the Bd-amphibian system, this indicates a need to correct for imperfect pathogen detection in enzootic host populations persisting with low-level infections. More generally, our results have implications for study designs in other disease systems, particularly those with similar objectives, biology, and sampling decisions. 4. Uncertainty in pathogen detection is an inherent property of most sampling protocols and diagnostic tests, where the magnitude of bias depends on the study system, type of infection, and false negative error rates. Given that it may be difficult to know this information in advance, we advocate that the most cautious approach is to assume all errors are possible and to accommodate them by adjusting sampling designs. The modelling framework presented here improves the accuracy in estimating pathogen prevalence and infection intensity.","MAYBE"

Sensitivity analysis (SA) is commonly used to quantify the impacts of parameters on outputs, and guide the calibration process. Here we demonstrate a systematic approach for SA, which assures that (1) the role of time-dependency in the sensitivity indices is considered and (2) the SA is not biased by the edapho-climatic conditions at individual sites.

Effective wildlife habitat management and conservation requires understanding the factors influencing distribution and abundance of plant species. Field studies, however, have documented observation errors in visually estimated plant cover including measurements which differ from the true value (measurement error) and not observing a species that is present within a plot (detection error). Unlike the rapid expansion of occupancy and N-mixture models for analysing wildlife surveys, development of statistical models accounting for observation error in plants has not progressed quickly. Our work informs development of a monitoring protocol for managed wetlands within the National Wildlife Refuge System. 2. Zero-augmented beta (ZAB) regression is the most suitable method for analysing areal plant cover recorded as a continuous proportion but assumes no observation errors. We present a model extension that explicitly includes the observation process thereby accounting for both measurement and detection errors. Using simulations, we compare our approach to a ZAB regression that ignores observation errors (naive model) and an ad hoc approach using a composite of multiple observations per plot within the naive model. We explore how sample size and within-season revisit design affect the ability to detect a change in mean plant cover between 2years using our model. 3. Explicitly modelling the observation process within our framework produced unbiased estimates and nominal coverage of model parameters. The naive and ad hoc approaches resulted in underestimation of occurrence and overestimation of mean cover. The degree of bias was primarily driven by imperfect detection and its relationship with cover within a plot. Conversely, measurement error had minimal impacts on inferences. We found >30 plots with at least three within-season revisits achieved reasonable posterior probabilities for assessing change in mean plant cover. 4. For rapid adoption and application, code for Bayesian estimation of our single-species ZAB with errors model is included.

We contend that citizen science methods, within the context of East African drylands, may be more appropriate for species with large body sizes, which are relatively rare, or those that form small herds. VCS perceptions of the charisma of a species may also influence their enthusiasm for recording it. 4.

We introduce a general class of statistical PVA that can be applied to many populations at once, which we term multiple population viability analysis or MPVA. The approach combines models of abundance at multiple spatial locations with temporal models of population dynamics, effectively borrowing information from more data-rich populations to inform inferences for data-poor populations. Covariates are used to explain population variability in space and time. Using Bayesian analysis, we illustrate the method with a dataset of Lahontan cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi) observations that previously had been analyzed with conventional PVA. We find that MPVA predictions are similar in bias and higher in precision than predictions from simple PVA models that treat each population individually; moreover, the use of covariates in MPVA allows for predictions in minimally-sampled and unsampled populations.

The model simulates tree-level growth, mortality, and recruitment, which we parameterized from data on both individual-level demographic rates and population-level abundance using Bayesian inverse modelling. Across a set of 1 degrees grid cells, we calibrated local growth, mortality, and recruitment rates for each PFT to obtain a close match between predicted age-specific PFT basal area in forest stands and that observed in 46,603 Forest Inventory and Analysis plots. The resulting models produced a strong fit to PFT basal area across the region (R-2 = 0.66-0.87), captured successional changes in PFT composition with stand age, and predicted the overall stem diameter distribution well. The mortality rates needed to accurately predict basal area were consistently higher than observed mortality, possibly because sampling effects led to biased individual-level mortality estimates across spatially heterogeneous plots. Growth and recruitment rates did not show consistent directional changes from observed values. Relative basal area was most strongly influenced by recruitment processes, but the effects of growth and mortality tended to increase as stands matured. Our study illustrates how both top-down (population-level) and bottom-up (individual-level) data can be combined to predict variation in abundance from size, environmental, and competitive effects on tree demography. Evidence for how demographic processes influence variation in abundance, as provided by our model, can help in understanding how these forests may respond to future environmental change.","NO"

Despite their wide application in ecology and conservation biology, the inference and projection of these models may be problematic when residual spatial auto correlation (SAC) is found. We aimed to improve the inference and projection of population dynamics models by accounting for residual SAC. We considered three Gompertz models that incorporated density dependence and the effect of wetland habitat to explain and project the abundance of Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). We compared a conventional model that did not account for residual SAC (ENV) with two novel models accounting for residual SAC, one incorporating a spatial effect (a spatially autocorrelated process error) that did not vary over time (STA) and the other incorporating a spatial effect that varied over time (DYN). We evaluated model inference using data from 1974 to 1998 and projection using data from 1999 to 2010. We then forecasted Mallard abundance from 2011 to 2100 under different levels of wetland habitat loss. The DYN model eliminated residual SAC and had better model fit than the ENV and STA models (Delta(D) over bar = 2498.3 and 1988.8, respectively). The projection coverage rate of the DYN model was the closest to the nominal value among the three models. The DYN model forecasted smaller areas with decrease in Mallard abundance under future wetland habitat loss than the ENV and STA models. The novel and conventional population dynamics models we considered in this study, combined with the practical model evaluation approach, can provide reliable inference and projection of wildlife abundance, and thus have wide application in ecological studies and conservation practices that aim to understand and project the spatiotemporal variation of wildlife abundance under environmental changes. In particular, when conservation decision-making is based on model projections, the DYN may be used to minimize the risk of reducing conservation effort in areas that still have high conservation value, due to its favorable projection performance.

The model runs in discrete time at plant scale and describes plant growth and pathogen dynamics under optimal epidemiological conditions. The model is divided into two modules: a deterministic plant sub-model that simulates the simplified architecture and growth of the banana, and a pathogen sub-model that simulates the detailed life cycle of the pathogen including infection, lesion growth, asexual and sexual sporulation, and the dispersal of spores on the plant. The three most influential epidemiological parameters identified by sensitivity analysis of the model (lesion growth rate, infection efficiency, and incubation period) were estimated in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and acquired data on the dynamics of leaf lesions under natural conditions. The posterior densities provided precise knowledge on pathogen life history traits. The evaluation of the model using an independent data set confirmed the good quality of the predictions.

Accurate knowledge of species occurrence is fundamental to a wide variety of ecological, evolutionary and conservation applications. Assessing the presence or absence of species at sites is often complicated by imperfect detection, with different mechanisms potentially contributing to false-negative and/or false-positive errors at different sampling stages. Ambiguities in the data mean that estimation of relevant parameters might be confounded unless additional information is available to resolve those uncertainties. 2. Here, we consider the analysis of species detection data with false-positive and false-negative errors at multiple levels. We develop and examine a two-stage occupancy-detection model for this purpose. We use profile likelihoods for identifiability analysis and estimation, and study the types of additional data required for reliable estimation. We test the model with simulated data, and then analyse data from environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys of four Australian frog species. In our case study, we consider that false positives may arise due to contamination at the water sample and quantitative PCR-sample levels, whereas false negatives may arise due to eDNA not being captured in a field sample, or due to the sensitivity of laboratory tests. We augment our eDNA survey data with data from aural surveys and laboratory calibration experiments. 3. We demonstrate that the two-stage model with false-positive and false-negative errors is not identifiable if only survey data prone to false positives are available. At least two sources of extra information are required for reliable estimation (e.g. records from a survey method with unambiguous detections, and a calibration experiment). Alternatively, identifiability can be achieved by setting plausible bounds on false detection rates as prior information in a Bayesian setting. The results of our case study matched our simulations with respect to data requirements, and revealed false-positive rates greater than zero for all species. 4. We provide statistical modelling tools to account for uncertainties in species occurrence survey data when false negatives and false positives could occur at multiple sampling stages. Such data are often needed to support management and policy decisions. Dealing with these uncertainties is relevant for traditional survey methods, but also for promising new techniques, such as eDNA sampling.","YES"

Generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM) is a statistical method for analysing and predicting patterns of turnover in species composition, usually in response to environmental gradients that vary in space and time. GDM is becoming widely applied in ecology and conservation science to interpret macro-ecological and biogeographical patterns, to support conservation assessment, predict changes in species distributions under climate change and prioritise biological surveys. 2. Inferential and predictive uncertainty is difficult to characterise using current implementations of GDM, reducing the utility of GDM in ecological risk assessment and conservation decision-making. Current practice is to undertake permutation tests to assess the importance of variables in GDM. Permutation testing overcomes the issue of data-dependence (because dissimilarities are calculated on a smaller number of observations) but it does not give a quantification of uncertainty in predictions. Here, we address this issue by utilising the Bayesian bootstrap, so that the uncertainty in the observations is carried through the entire analysis (including into the predictions). 3. We tested our Bayesian bootstrap GDM (BBGDM) approach on simulated data sets and two benthic species data sets. We fitted BBGDMs and GDMs to compare the differences in inference and prediction of compositional turnover that resulted from a coherent treatment of model uncertainty. We showed that our BBGDM approach correctly identified the signal within the data, resulting in an improved characterisation of uncertainty and enhanced model-based inference. 4. We show that our approach gives appropriate parameter estimates while better representing the underlying uncertainty that arises when conducting inference and making predictions with GDMs. Our approach to fitting GDMs will provide more realistic insights intoparameter and prediction uncertainty.","NO"

However, addressing this hypothesis has proved challenging because of the risk of over-looking rare interactions, and hence biasing specialization estimations, and the difficulties to separate the diversity component attributable to insect specialization from that related to host diversity. As a result, the host specialization hypothesis lacks empirical support for important phytophagous insect clades. Here, we test the hypothesis in a radiation of seed-feeding insects, acorn weevils (Curculio spp.), sampled in temperate and tropical regions (California and Nicaragua, respectively) with an equivalent pool of oak host species. Using DNA sequences from three low-copy genes, we delimited to species level 778 weevil larvae extracted from host seeds and assessed their phylogenetic relationships by Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference. We then reconstructed the oak-weevil food webs and examined differences in alpha, beta and gamma diversity using Hill numbers of effective species. We found a higher alpha, beta and gamma diversity of weevils in Nicaragua compared to California despite similar richness of host species at both local and regional level. By means of Bayesian mixed models, we also found that tropical weevil species were highly specialized both in terms of host range and interaction strength, whereas their temperate congeners had a broader taxonomic and phylogenetic host spectrum. Finally, in Nicaraguan species, larval body size was highly correlated with the size of the acorns infested, as would be expected by a greater host specialization, whereas in California this relationship was absent. Altogether, these lines of evidence support the host specialization hypothesis and suggest contrasting eco-evolutionary dynamics in tropical and temperate regions even in absence of differences in host diversity.","NO"

We apply the approach to a case study from Ghana, where farmers seek to decide on the most profitable of three agricultural systems (dryland crops, irrigated crops and livestock) by a continuous updating of beliefs relative to realised trajectories of climate (change), represented by projections of temperature and precipitation. The climate data is based on combinations of output from three global/regional climate model combinations and two future scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) representing moderate and unsubstantial greenhouse gas reduction policies, respectively. The results indicate that the climate scenario (input) holds a significant influence on the development of beliefs, net revenues and thereby optimal farming practices. Further, despite uncertainties in the underlying net revenue functions, the study shows that when the beliefs of the farmer (decision-maker) opposes the development of the realised climate, the Bayesian methodology allows for simulating an adjustment of such beliefs, when improved information becomes available. The framework can, therefore, help facilitating the optimal choice between agricultural systems considering the influence of climate change.","NO"

Their joint implementation in a mechanistic modeling framework should help us to bring community ecology to a new level by improving its predictive abilities. One of the challenges lies in the proper consideration of model uncertainty. In this paper, we contribute to this challenging task by modeling the temporal dynamics of macro invertebrate communities in a stream subjected to hydropeaking in Switzerland. To this end, we extended the mechanistic model Streambugs regarding flood-induced drift processes and the use of trait information to define performance filters. Model predictions without any calibration were in the right order of magnitude but did not reflect the dynamics of most of the invertebrate taxa well. Bayesian inference drastically improved the model fit. It revealed that a large share of total model output uncertainty can be attributed to observation errors, which exceeded model parameter uncertainty. Observed and simulated community-aggregated traits helped to identify and understand model deficits. The combination of different ecological theories and trait information in a single mechanistic modeling framework combined with Bayesian inference can thus help to predict responses of communities to environmental changes, which can support ecosystem management.","MAYBE"

We fit the model in a Bayesian framework using MCMC sampling, which allowed for estimation of unobserved latent growth while propagating uncertainty. Fitting the model to simulated data varying in sampling design and parameter values demonstrated that the parameter estimates were accurate, precise, and unbiased.

Stable hydrogen isotope (delta D) methods for tracking animal movement are widely used yet often produce low resolution assignments. Incorporating prior knowledge of abundance, distribution or movement patterns can ameliorate this limitation, but data are lacking for most species. We demonstrate how observations reported by citizen scientists can be used to develop robust estimates of species distributions and to constrain dD assignments. 2. We developed a Bayesian framework to refine isotopic estimates of migrant animal origins conditional on species distribution models constructed from citizen scientist observations. To illustrate this approach, we analysed the migratory connectivity of the Virginia rail Rallus limicola, a secretive and declining migratory game bird in North America. 3. Citizen science observations enabled both estimation of sampling bias and construction of bias-corrected species distribution models. Conditioning dD assignments on these species distribution models yielded comparably high-resolution assignments. 4. Most Virginia rails wintering across five Gulf Coast sites spent the previous summer near the Great Lakes, although a considerable minority originated from the Chesapeake Bay watershed or Prairie Pothole region of North Dakota. Conversely, the majority of migrating Virginia rails from a site in the Great Lakes most likely spent the previous winter on the Gulf Coast between Texas and Louisiana. 5. Synthesis and applications.

A relatively new software platform called Stan uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), a family of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms which promise improved efficiency and faster inference relative to those used by BUGS. Stan is gaining traction in many fields as an alternative to BUGS, but adoption has been slow in ecology, likely due in part to the complex nature of HMC. Here, we provide an intuitive illustration of the principles of HMC on a set of simple models. We then compared the relative efficiency of BUGS and Stan using population ecology models that vary in size and complexity. For hierarchical models, we also investigated the effect of an alternative parameterization of random effects, known as non-centering. For small, simple models there is little practical difference between the two platforms, but Stan outperforms BUGS as model size and complexity grows. Stan also performs well for hierarchical models, but is more sensitive to model parameterization than BUGS. Stan may also be more robust to biased inference caused by pathologies, because it produces diagnostic warnings where BUGS provides none. Disadvantages of Stan include an inability to use discrete parameters, more complex diagnostics and a greater requirement for hands-on tuning. Given these results, Stan is a valuable tool for many ecologists utilizing Bayesian inference, particularly for problems where BUGS is prohibitively slow. As such, Stan can extend the boundaries of feasible models for applied problems, leading to better understanding of ecological processes. Fields that would likely benefit include estimation of individual and population growth rates, meta-analyses and cross-system comparisons and spatiotemporal models.","NO"

We discussed differences between the classic and the proposed frameworks and emphasized the importance of the time axis in understanding species' existence status. We exemplified the implementation potential of this framework by reviewing published studies of physiological limits (temperature and salinity) for survival, growth, and reproduction of invasive freshwater bivalves in USA. We found considerable amount of physiological information through the literature review, though there is a research bias toward more influential invasive species (vs. less influential invasive species), temperature tolerance (vs. salinity tolerance), and survival limits (vs. growth and reproduction limits); filling the knowledge gaps will strengthen the potential of the proposed framework.

The two-dimensional hydraulic model was set up using Navier-Stokes equations and was calculated by applying the finite volume method. The Bayesian method was employed to calibrate the model parameters and obtain the parameter posterior distribution. The two-dimensional hydraulic information and the parameter posterior distribution were utilized to calculate a two-dimensional uncertainty eutrophication model, for which the 95% confidence interval (uncertainty bounds which can provide the trend and range for water quality changes) and mean value of every water quality index (nitrate, ammonia, phosphate, Chl. a and dissolved oxygen) were simulated. Comparisons between the model simulations and the field data indicated that the models were able to calculate the hydrodynamic information and the eutrophication dynamics with reasonable accuracy (all the relative errors lower than 11%). The simulated concentrations of water quality indexes (nitrate, ammonia, phosphate and Chl. a.) in the vicinity of the lake were higher than that in the middle of the lake during the simulation period, indicating that the nutrient load of the rainwater runoff had significant impacts on algal blooms and water quality. Therefore, the urban lake was vulnerable to the influence of rainwater runoff. To reduce the eutrophication risk, rainwater runoff needs to be controlled.

The connection between breeding and non-breeding grounds is defined as migratory connectivity. The quantification of such connectivity is important, because movements between different locations can have strong consequences for the moving animal as well as the encountered habitats or ecosystems. Connectivity is usually investigated either on the basis of (few unsystematic) re-encounters of (often large numbers of) marked individuals or by observations of a few individuals tracked by remote sensing techniques, i.e. GPS or geolocation. The combination of qualitatively different data sets can reduce the limitations of each type of data and thus improve the accuracy of the estimated connectivity parameters considerably. We formally combine individual tracking data and mark re-encounter data in a probabilistic model framework for quantifying connectivity. In a first example, we quantify migratory connectivity of a long-distance passerine migrant based on ring re-encounter and geolocator data. As a second example, we combine re-encounter data of ear-tagged wild boars with GPS tracking data to estimate the spatial distribution of wild boars during the hunting and the non-hunting seasons. These two examples illustrate the use of the model in two different framework: 1) long-distance migration and, 2) seasonal (e.g. hunting induced) non-migratory movements. Results from the integrated analyses provided more information than the informal comparison of the results from independent analyses on each data set separately. Parameter estimates were more precise in the integrated analyses compared to the separate analyses and stronger conclusions could be drawn.

Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures (BAMM) is a flexible Bayesian framework for inferring the number and location of shifts in macroevolutionary rate across phylogenetic trees and has been widely used in empirical studies. BAMM requires that researchers specify a prior probability distribution on the number of diversification rate shifts before conducting an analysis. The consequences of this model prior' for inference are poorly known but could potentially influence both the probability of accepting models that are more (high error rate) or less (low power) complex than the generating model. The hierarchical Poisson process prior in BAMM reduces to a simple geometric distribution on number of rate shifts, and we use this property to increase the efficiency of model selection with Bayes factors. Using BAMM v2.5, we analysed phylogenies simulated with and without diversification heterogeneity across a broad range of prior parameterizations. We also assessed the impact of the model prior on MCMC convergence times and on diversification rate estimates. For all simulation scenarios, model evidence (Bayes factor support) for the number of shifts is not sensitive to the choice of model prior over the wide range examined here. The best-supported model found using BAMM rarely includes spurious shifts (<2% of all runs) when diversification models are selected using Bayes factors. BAMM was reliably able to infer the true number of diversification rate shifts across prior expectations that varied by three orders of magnitude. However, we find a strong effect of model prior on MCMC convergence properties: a flatter prior distribution (larger expected number of shifts) can dramatically increase the efficiency of the MCMC simulation. Our results support the use of a liberal model prior in BAMM, as it reduces computation time without distorting the evidence for rate heterogeneity.","YES"

A primary goal of our work is to clarify the concept of strong consistency in model selection. Explicit considerations of this principle (including the strong consistency of BIC) are currently limited to technical derivations, inaccessible to most ecologists. We use our graphical framework to demonstrate, in simple terms, the strong consistency of both BIC and Good's compromise. Our framework also locates the evaluated metrics (and ICs in general) along a conceptual continuum of hypothesis refutation/confirmation that considers n, parameter number and effect size. Along this continuum, significance testing and particularly AIC are refutative for H-0, whereas Good's compromise and particularly BIC are confirmatory for the true hypothesis. Our work graphically demonstrates the well-known asymptotic bias of significance tests for H-A, and the incorrectness of using statistically non-consistent methods for point hypothesis testing. To address these issues, we recommend: (i) dedicated confirmatory methods with strong consistency like BIC for use in point hypothesis testing and confirmatory model selection; (ii) significance tests for use in exploratory/refutative hypothesis testing, particularly when conjoined with rational approaches (e.g. Good's compromise, power analyses) to account for the effect of n on P-values; and (iii) asymptotically efficient methods like AIC for exploratory model selection.","MAYBE"

The specific technique of model averaging was developed to improve predictive ability by combining predictions from a set of models. However, it is now often used to average regression coefficients across multiple models with the ultimate goal of capturing a variable's overall effect. This use of model averaging implicitly assumes the same parameter exists across models so that averaging is sensible. While this assumption may initially seem tenable, regression coefficients associated with particular explanatory variables may not hold equivalent interpretations across all of the models in which they appear, making explanatory inference about covariates challenging. Accessibility to easily implementable software, concerns about being criticized for ignoring model uncertainty, and the chance to avoid having to justify choice of a final model have all led to the increasing popularity of model averaging in practice.

The model was fit using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, which estimated transition probabilities, as well as unique Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion and centralizing tendency parameters. Estimated parameters could then be used to simulate movement and space use that was virtually indistinguishable from real data. We used Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) scores to assess model fit and determined that both wind and reproductive status were predictive of transitions between home-range centers. Females were less likely to move between home-range centers on windy days, less likely to move between centers when tending pups, and much more likely to move between centers just after weaning a pup. These tendencies are predicted by theoretical movement rules but were not previously known and show that our model can extract meaningful behavioral insight from complex movement data.","NO"

However, no studies have examined the effects of sea ice on foraging Pacific walrus space use patterns. We tested a series of hypotheses that examined walrus foraging resource selection as a function of proximity to resting substrates and prey biomass. We quantified walrus prey biomass with 17 benthic invertebrate families, which included bivalves, polychaetes, amphipods, tunicates, and sipunculids. We included covariates fordistance to sea ice and distance to land, and systematically developed a series of candidate models to examine interactions among benthic prey biomass and resting substrates. We ranked candidate models with Bayesian Information Criterion and made inferences on walrus resource selection based on the top-ranked model. Based on the top model, biomass of the bivalve family Tellinidae, distance to ice, distance to land, and the interaction of distances to ice and land all positively influenced walrus foraging resource selection. Standardized model coefficients indicated that distance to ice explained the most variation in walrus foraging resource selection followed by Tellinidae biomass. Distance to land and the interaction of distances to ice and land accounted for similar levels of variation. Tellinidae biomass likely represented an index of overall bivalve biomass, indicating walruses focused foraging in areas with elevated levels of bivalve and tellinid biomass. Our results also emphasize the importance of sea ice to walruses. Projected sea ice loss will increase the duration of the open water season in the Chukchi Sea, altering the spatial distribution of resting sites relative to current foraging areas and possibly affecting the spatial structure of benthic communities.

These models have been used on count data for single species that can be identified with certainty. However, co-occurring species often look similar during one or more life stages, making it difficult to assign species for all recorded captures. This uncertainty creates problems for estimating species-specific abundance, and it can often limit life stages to which we can make inference. We present a new extension of N-mixture models that accounts for species uncertainty. In addition to estimating site-specific abundances and detection probabilities, this model allows estimating probability of correct assignment of species identity. We implement this hierarchical model in a Bayesian framework and provide all code for running the model in BUGS language programs. We present an application of the model on count data from two sympatric freshwater fishes, the brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans) and the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), and illustrate implementation of covariate effects (habitat characteristics). In addition, we used a simulation study to validate the model and illustrate potential sample size issues. We also compared, for both real and simulated data, estimates provided by our model to those obtained by a simple N-mixture model when captures of unknown species identification were discarded. In the latter case, abundance estimates appeared highly biased and very imprecise, while our new model provided unbiased estimates with higher precision. This extension of the N-mixture model should be useful for a wide variety of studies and taxa, as species uncertainty is a common issue. It should notably help improve investigation of abundance and vital rate characteristics of organisms' early life stages, which are sometimes more difficult to identify than adults.","MAYBE"

As such, eDNA is a potentially rich source of data for basic ecology, conservation, and management, because it offers the prospect of quantitatively reconstructing whole ecological communities from easily obtained samples. However, like all sampling methods, eDNA sequencing is subject to methodological limitations that can generate biased descriptions of ecological communities. Here, we demonstrate parallels between eDNA sampling and traditional sampling techniques, and use these parallels to offer a statistical structure for framing the challenges faced by eDNA and for illuminating the gaps in our current knowledge. Although the current state of knowledge on some of these steps precludes a full estimate of biomass for each taxon in a sampled eDNA community, we provide a map that illustrates potential methods for bridging these gaps. Additionally, we use an original data set to estimate the relative abundances of taxon-specific template DNA prior to PCR, given the abundance of DNA sequences recovered post-PCR-and-sequencing, a critical step in the chain of eDNA inference. While we focus on the use of eDNA samples to determine the relative abundance of taxa within a community, our approach also applies to single-taxon applications (including applications using qPCR), studies of diversity, and studies focused on occurrence. By grounding inferences about eDNA community composition in a rigorous statistical framework, and by making these inferences explicit, we hope to improve the inferential potential for the emerging field of community-level eDNA analysis.","NO"

In this study, we took advantage of an extensive felled-tree database (with 2885 foliage biomass observations) to compare different models and grouping schemes based on phylogenetic and geographic variation for predicting foliage biomass at the tree scale. We adopted a Bayesian hierarchical statistical framework, first to compare linear models that predict foliage biomass directly to models that separately estimate a foliage ratio as a component of total aboveground biomass, then to compare species specific models to both 'narrow' and 'broad' general biomass models using the best fitted functional form. We evaluated models by simulating new datasets from the posterior predictive distribution, using both summary statistics and visual assessments of model performance. Key findings of our study were: (1) simple linear models provided a better fit to our data than component ratio models, where total biomass and the foliar ratio are estimated separately; (2) species-specific equations provided the best predictive performance, and there was no advantage to narrow species groupings relative to broader groups; and (3) all three model schemes (i.e., species-specific models versus narrow or broad groupings proposed in national-scale biomass equations) tended to over-predict foliage biomass and resulted in predictions with very high uncertainty, particularly for large diameter trees. This analysis represents a fundamental shift in carbon accounting by employing felled-tree data to refine our understanding of uncertainty associated with component biomass estimates, and presents an ideal approach to account for tree-scale allometric model error when estimating forest carbon stocks.

Recent statistical models in ecology have been developed to accommodate false-negative errors, although current work points to false-positive errors as equally important sources of bias. This is of particular concern for the success of any monitoring programme given that rates as small as 3% could lead to the overestimation of the occurrence of rare events by as much as 50%, and even small false-positive rates can severely bias estimates of occurrence dynamics. We present an integrated, computationally efficient Bayesian hierarchical model to correct for false-positive and false-negative errors in detection/non-detection data. Our model combines independent, auxiliary data sources with field observations to improve the estimation of false-positive rates, when a subset of field observations cannot be validated a posteriori or assumed as perfect. We evaluated the performance of the model across a range of occurrence rates, false-positive and false-negative errors, and quantity of auxiliary data. The model performed well under all simulated scenarios, and we were able to identify critical auxiliary data characteristics which resulted in improved inference. We applied our false-positive model to a large-scale, citizen-science monitoring programme for anurans in the north-eastern United States, using auxiliary data from an experiment designed to estimate false-positive error rates. Not correcting for false-positive rates resulted in biased estimates of occupancy in 4 of the 10 anuran species we analysed, leading to an overestimation of the average number of occupied survey routes by as much as 70%. The framework we present for data collection and analysis is able to efficiently provide reliable inference for occurrence patterns using data from a citizen-science monitoring programme.

The proliferation of livestock provides an abundant food resource for this obligate blood-feeding species that could alter its foraging behaviour and rabies transmission, but poor understanding of the dietary plasticity of vampire bats limits understanding of how livestock influences rabies risk. We analysed individual- and population-level foraging behaviour by applying C-13 and N-15 stable isotope analysis to hair samples from 183 vampire bats captured from nine colonies in Peru. We also assessed the isotopic distributions of realized prey by analysing blood meals extracted from engorged bats and samples collected from potential prey species. In two adjacent but contrasting areas of the Amazon with scarce and abundant livestock, we used questionnaires to evaluate the incidence of feeding on humans. Population-level isotopic signatures suggested substantial among-site variation in feeding behaviour, including reliance on livestock in some colonies and feeding on combinations of domestic and wild prey in others. Isotopic heterogeneity within bat colonies was among the largest recorded in vertebrate populations, indicating that individuals consistently fed on distinct prey resources and across distinct trophic levels. In some sites, isotopic values of realized prey spanned broad ranges, suggesting that bats with intermediate isotopic values could plausibly be dietary specialists rather than generalists. Bayesian estimates of isotopic niche width varied up to ninefold among colonies and were maximized where wildlife and livestock were present at low levels, but declined with greater availability of livestock. In the Amazon, the absence of livestock was associated with feeding on humans and wildlife.Policy implications. We provide the first insights into the foraging behaviour of vampire bats in habitats with common depredation on humans and show how vampire bat foraging may respond to land-use change. Our results demonstrate risks of rabies transmission from bats to other wildlife and are consistent with the hypothesis that introducing livestock might reduce the burden of human rabies in high-risk communities.","NO"

If the analysis of the environmental impact is based on data at a relatively coarse-scale (e.g. farm, country, or large administrative regions), conclusions can be misleading. For an accurate assessment of agri-environmental indicators, data of agricultural activities and their dynamics are needed at high spatial resolution. In this paper, we develop and validate a spatial model for predicting the agricultural land-use areas within the homogenous spatial units (HSUs). For the EU-28 countries, we distinguish about 1.5 x 10(5) HSUs and we consider 30 possible land-uses to match with the classification used in the Common Agricultural Policy Regionalized Impact (CAPRI) model. The comparison of model predictions with independent observations and with a simple rule-based approach at HSU level demonstrates that the predictions are generally accurate in more than 75 % of HSUs.

Even in the apparently straightforward case of choosing between standard linear regression models, there does not yet appear to be consensus in the statistical ecology literature as to the right approach. We review recent works on model selection in ecology and subsequently focus on one aspect in particular: the use of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or its small-sample equivalent, AICC. We create a novel framework for simulation studies and use this to study model selection from simulated data sets with a range of properties, which differ in terms of degree of unobserved heterogeneity. We use the results of the simulation study to suggest an approach for model selection based on ideas from information criteria but requiring simulation. We find that the relative predictive performance of model selection by different information criteria is heavily dependent on the degree of unobserved heterogeneity between data sets. When heterogeneity is small, AIC or AICC are likely to perform well, but if heterogeneity is large, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) will often perform better, due to the stronger penalty afforded. Our conclusion is that the choice of information criterion (or more broadly, the strength of likelihood penalty) should ideally be based upon hypothesized (or estimated from previous data) properties of the population of data sets from which a given data set could have arisen. Relying on a single form of information criterion is unlikely to be universally successful.","YES"

This is especially crucial in species distributed across a large range where spatial heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict the distribution of genetic diversity. Although biogeographical models provide expectations of how spatially structured genetic variation may be at the range scale, human disturbance may cause strong deviations from these theoretical predictions. In this study, we investigated genetic structure and demography at a pan-European scale in the corncrake Crex crex, a grassland bird species strongly affected by agricultural changes. We assessed population structure and genetic diversity, as well as demographic trends and direction of gene flow, in and among 15 contemporary populations of this species. Analyses revealed low genetic structure across the entire range with high levels of genetic diversity in all sites. However, we found some evidence that the westernmost populations were, to a very limited extent, differentiated from the rest of the European population. Demographic trends showed that population numbers have decreased in western Europe and remained constant across eastern Europe. Results may also indicate asymmetric gene flow from eastern to western populations. In conclusion, we suggest that the most likely scenario is that contrasting demographic regimes between eastern and western populations, driven by heterogeneous human activity, has caused not only asymmetric gene flow that has buffered small peripheral populations against genetic diversity loss, but also erased any genetic structure that may have existed. Our study not only highlights the need for coordinated action at the European scale to preserve source populations of the corncrake, but also to ensure persistence of the most threatened sites. Only by doing so will we avoid losing adaptive potential and prevent over-reliance on eastern source populations whose future may be uncertain. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","NO"

Distance sampling is a common survey method in wildlife studies, because it allows accounting for imperfect detection. The framework has been extended to hierarchical distance sampling (HDS), which accommodates the modelling of abundance as a function of covariates, but rare and elusive species may not yield enough observations to fit such a model. 2. We integrate HDS into a community modelling framework that accommodates multi-species spatially replicated distance sampling data. The model allows species-specific parameters, but these come from a common underlying distribution. This form of information sharing enables estimation of parameters for species with sparse data sets that would otherwise be discarded from analysis. We evaluate the performance of the model under varying community sizes with different species-specific abundances through a simulation study. We further fit the model to a seabird data set obtained from shipboard distance sampling surveys off the East Coast of the USA. 3. Comparing communities comprised of 5, 15 or 30 species, bias of all community-level parameters and some species-level parameters decreased with increasing community size, while precision increased. Most species-level parameters were less biased for more abundant species. For larger communities, the community model increased precision in abundance estimates of rarely observed species when compared to single-species models. For the seabird application, we found a strong negative association of community and species abundance with distance to shore. Water temperature and prey density had weak effects on seabird abundance. Patterns in overall abundance were consistent with known seabird ecology. 4. The community distance sampling model can be expanded to account for imperfect availability, imperfect species identification or other missing individual covariates. The model allowed us to make inference about ecology of species communities, including rarely observed species, which is particularly important in conservation and management. The approach holds great potential to improve inference on species communities that can be surveyed with distance sampling.","NO"

The main challenge in an analysis of data with false positives is to distinguish false positive and false negative processes while modelling realistic levels of heterogeneity in occupancy and detection probabilities without restrictive assumptions about parameter spaces. 3. Building on previous attempts to account for false positive and false negative detections in occupancy models, we present hierarchical Bayesian models that utilize a subset of data with either confirmed detections of a species' presence (CP model) or both confirmed presences and confirmed absences (CACP model). We demonstrate that our models overcome the challenges associated with false positive data by evaluating model performance in Monte Carlo simulations of a variety of scenarios. Our models also have the ability to improve inference by incorporating previous knowledge through informative priors. 4. We describe an example application of the CP model to quantify the relationship between songbird occupancy and residential development, plus we provide instructions for ecologists to use the CACP and CP models in their own research. 5. Monte Carlo simulation results indicated that, when data contained false positive detections, the CACP and CP models generated more accurate and precise posterior probability distributions than a model that assumed data did not have false positive errors. For the scenarios we expect to be most generally applicable, those with heterogeneity in occupancy and detection, the CACP and CP models generated essentially unbiased posterior occupancy probabilities. The CACP model with vague priors generated unbiased posterior distributions for covariate coefficients.

We present a new F-ST-based genome-scan method, BayeScEnv, which incorporates environmental information in the form of 'environmental differentiation'. It is based on the F model, but, as opposed to existing approaches, it considers two locus-specific effects: one due to divergent selection and the other due to various other processes different from local adaptation (e.g. range expansions, differences in mutation rates across loci or background selection). The method was developped in C++ and is available at http://github.com/devillemereuil/bayescenv. 3. A simulation study shows that our method has a much lower false positive rate than an existing FST-based method, BayeScan, under a wide range of demographic scenarios.

We apply this model to an existing dataset of inflorescence counts and bumble bee pollen loads sampled at different field sites in California. For two out of three sites, a foraging model consisting in correlated random walks with constant preferences for each plant species provides a plausible fit for the observed distribution of pollen load content. Pollen load compositions at the third site could be explained by an extension of the model, where different preferences apply to the choice of an initial foraging patch and subsequent foraging steps. Since this model describes the expected level of pollen load differentiation due solely to the spatial clustering of conspecific plants, it provides a null hypothesis against which more complex descriptions of behavior (e.g. flower constancy) can be tested.

Understanding the patterns and extent of illegal activities is therefore essential for effective law enforcement and prevention of biodiversity declines. We used extensive data, commonly collected by ranger patrols in many protected areas, and Bayesian hierarchical models to identify drivers, trends, and distribution of multiple illegal activities within the Queen Elizabeth Conservation Area (QECA), Uganda. Encroachment (e.g., by pastoralists with cattle) and poaching of noncommercial animals (e.g., snaring bushmeat) were the most prevalent illegal activities within the QECA. Illegal activities occurred in different areas of the QECA. Poaching of noncommercial animals was most widely distributed within the national park. Overall, ecological covariates, although significant, were not useful predictors for occurrence of illegal activities. Instead, the location of illegal activities in previous years was more important. There were significant increases in encroachment and noncommercial plant harvesting (nontimber products) during the study period (1999-2012). We also found significant spatiotemporal variation in the occurrence of all activities. Our results show the need to explicitly model ranger patrol effort to reduce biases from existing uncorrected or capture per unit effort analyses. Prioritization of ranger patrol strategies is needed to target illegal activities; these strategies are determined by protected area managers, and therefore changes at a site-level can be implemented quickly. These strategies should also be informed by the location of past occurrences of illegal activity: the most useful predictor of future events. However, because spatial and temporal changes in illegal activities occurred, regular patrols throughout the protected area, even in areas of low occurrence, are also required.","NO"

Occupancy models are employed in species distribution modelling to account for imperfect detection during field surveys. While this approach is popular in the literature, problems can occur when estimating the model parameters. In particular, the maximum likelihood estimates can exhibit bias and large variance for data sets with small sample sizes, which can result in estimated occupancy probabilities near 0 and 1 ('boundary estimates'). 2. In this paper, we explore strategies for estimating parameters based on maximizing a penalized likelihood. Penalized likelihood methods augment the usual likelihood with a penalty function that encodes information about what parameter values are undesirable. We introduce penalties for occupancy models that have analogues in ridge regression and Bayesian approaches, and we compare them to a penalty developed for occupancy models in prior work. 3. We examine the bias, variance and mean squared error of parameter estimates obtained from each method on synthetic data. Across all of the synthetic data sets, the penalized estimation methods had lower mean squared error than the maximum likelihood estimates. We also provide an example of the application of these methods to point counts of avian species. Penalized likelihood methods show similar improvements when tested using empirical bird point count data. 4. We discuss considerations for choosing among these methods when modelling occupancy. We conclude that penalized methods may be of practical utility for fitting occupancy models with small sample sizes, and we are releasing R code that implements these methods.","YES"

Setting such thresholds requires making implicit judgments about the degree of biodiversity loss that managers are willing to accept. We present a new modelling approach, the hierarchical diversity decision framework (HiDDeF) that explicitly communicates the sensitivity of water quality benchmarks to these implicit judgments. We apply HiDDeF to a data set of stream macroinvertebrate abundances across 218 sites in south-western West Virginia, USA, where alkaline mine drainage increases streamwater conductivity and leads to the loss of sensitive taxa throughout regional river networks. By integrating responses of individual taxa within a flexible hierarchical framework, HiDDeF reliably predicts macroinvertebrate assemblages across the full range of conductivities observed in the training data set but requires only a fraction (similar to 10%) of the sites required in previous studies. HiDDeF results suggest that the current conductivity benchmark (300Scm(-1)) for regional streams translates to 50% loss in abundance for at least one-quarter of regional macroinvertebrate taxa. HiDDeF produces a decision landscape' that allows decision-makers to assess sensitivity of proposed benchmarks to their choice of protective level.

For instance, the elements of metacommunity structure (EMS) framework uses species occurrence data to classify metacommunity structure and link it to underlying environmental gradients. While the efficacy of this approach relies on the quality of the data, few studies have considered how imperfect detection, which is widespread in ecological surveys and the major focus of occupancy modeling, affects the outcome. We introduce a framework that integrates multispecies occupancy models with the current EMS framework, detection error-corrected EMS (DECEMS). This method offers two distinct advantages. First, DECEMS reduces bias in characterizing metacommunity structure by using repeated surveys and occupancy models to disentangle species-specific occupancy and detection probabilities, ultimately bringing metacommunity structure classification into a more probabilistic framework. Second, occupancy modeling allows estimation of species-specific responses to environmental covariates, which will increase our ability to link species-level effects to metacommunity-wide patterns. After reviewing the EMS framework, we introduce a simple multispecies occupancy model and show how DECEMS can work in practice, highlighting that detection error often causes EMS to assign incorrect structures. To emphasize the broader applicability of this approach, we further illustrate that DECEMS can reduce the rate of structure misclassification by more than 20% in some cases, even proving useful when detection error rates are quite low (similar to 10%). Integrating occupancy models and the EMS framework will lead to more accurate descriptions of metacommunity structure and to a greater understanding of the mechanisms by which different structures arise.","MAYBE"

We found that when habitat preferences are strong or the number of presence-only locations is small, by chance, maximum likelihood coefficient estimates for the Poisson point process model may not exist. We found that several alternative estimation methods can produce reliable estimates, but results will depend on the chosen method. It is important to identify conditions for which maximum likelihood estimates are unlikely to be identifiable from presence-only data. In data sets where the maximum likelihood estimates do not exist, penalized likelihood and Bayesian methods will produce coefficient estimates, but these are sensitive to the choice of estimation procedure and prior or penalty term.

Fitting models of population dynamics to field data is challenging because most data sets are characterized by observation error, which can inflate estimates of process variation if ignored. Recently, state-space models have been developed to deal with this problem by directly modeling both the observation error and the ecological process of interest. Conventional state-space models, however, have several important limitations: (1) they assume that random effects are Gaussian distributed, which implies that abundance can be negative and that false positive observation errors are equally likely as false negative errors; (2) they do not admit spatial variation in population dynamics; and (3) some of the parameters of the model are not estimable. We demonstrate how each of these problems can be resolved using a class of hierarchical models proposed by Dail and Madsen (2011) that attributes observation error to imperfect detection. We expand this class of models to accommodate classical growth models (e.g., exponential and Ricker-logistic), zero-inflation, and random effects. We also present methods for forecasting population size under future environmental conditions. Implementation of these ideas is possible using either frequentist or Bayesian methods, as demonstrated by accompanying R and JAGS code. Results of a simulation study suggest that bias is negligible and coverage nominal in most cases for the proposed model extensions. An analysis of data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey highlights how these methods can be readily applied to existing data, but it also suggests that precision will be low when direct information about detection probability (such as is collected using distance sampling or replicated counts) is lacking.","MAYBE"

Yet rigorous verification is rare and the estimation of test accuracy (the probability that true positive and true negative samples are correctly identified - test sensitivity and specificity, respectively), particularly in combination with sequencing, is uncommon. This is important because PCR-based tests are prone to contamination in sampling and the laboratory. Here, we use an experimental case-control approach to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of a sequential PCR-based wildlife detection test used to identify incursions of red foxes into Tasmania from predator faeces (scats). Our results show that the sensitivity of the fox test is high (approximate to 94%) for the PCR-based test on its own, but this decreases to approximate to 84% when combined with the DNA sequencing step. In contrast, the specificity increases from approximate to 96% in the PCR-only test to 996% after inclusion of the DNA sequencing step. The intense public scrutiny of the fox eradication programme in Tasmania has undoubtedly influenced the application of a sequential PCR test that maximizes specificity at the expense of sensitivity and so increases the risk that scats containing fox DNA would not be detected. This could lead to the establishment of foxes in Tasmania as a consequence.Synthesis and applications. Importantly, the estimation of the sensitivity and specificity of sequential tests enables decisions about the risk associated with mistaken identification (i.e. false negatives vs. false positives) to be quantified for decision-makers. The cost of false-negative errors should be balanced against the costs of false-positive errors, which could include the expenditure incurred in the application of unnecessary management actions were foxes not in fact present.

ABC is a Bayesian framework that uses one or more summary statistics instead of the likelihood function. Crucial to the performance of an ABC algorithm is the choice of summary statistics. Here, we analyse the applicability of three traditional and often-used summary statistics (Gamma statistic, Phylogenetic Diversity and tree size) within an ABC framework and propose a new summary statistic: the normalized Lineages-Through-Time (nLTT) statistic.

SCR models are increasingly being used in ecological and conservation studies of mammals worldwide, but have received little testing with empirical field data. We use data collected via a web and grid sampling design to evaluate the basic SCR model where small-mammal abundance (N) and density (D) are known (via exhaustive sampling). We fit the basic SCR model with and without a behavioral effect to 11 small-mammal populations for each sampling design using a Bayesian and likelihood SCR modeling approach. We compare SCR and ad hoc density estimators using frequentist performance measures. We found Bayesian and likelihood SCR estimates of density ((D) over cap) and abundance ((N) over cap) to be similar. We also found SCR models to have moderately poor frequentist coverage of D and N (45-73%), high deviation from truth (i.e., accuracy; (D) over cap, 17-29%; (N) over cap, 16-29%), and consistent negative bias across inferential paradigms, sampling designs, and models. With the trapping grid data, the basic SCR model generally performed more poorly than the best ad hoc estimator (behavior CR super-population estimate divided by the full mean maximum distance moved estimate of the effective trapping area), whereas with the trapping web data, the best-performing SCR model (null) was comparable to the best distance model. Relatively poor frequentist SCR coverage resulted from higher precision (SCR coefficients of variation [CVs], ad hoc CVs); however (D) over cap and D were fairly well correlated (r(2) range of 0.77-0.96). SCR's negative relative bias (i.e., average underestimation of the true density) suggests additional heterogeneity in detection and/or that small mammals maintained asymmetric home ranges. We suggest caution in the use of the basic SCR model when trapping animals in a sampling grid and more generally when small sample sizes necessitate the spatial scale parameter (sigma) apply to all individuals. When possible, researchers should consider variation in detection and incorporate individual biological and/or ecological variation at the trap level when modeling sigma.","MAYBE"

Environmental laws require bycatch assessment for protected species, but this is difficult when bycatch is rare. Low bycatch rates, combined with low observer coverage, may lead to biased, imprecise estimates when using standard ratio estimators. Bayesian model-based approaches incorporate uncertainty, produce less volatile estimates, and enable probabilistic evaluation of estimates relative to management thresholds. Here, we demonstrate a pragmatic decision-making process that uses Bayesian model-based inferences to estimate the probability of exceeding management thresholds for bycatch in fisheries with <100% observer coverage. Using the California drift gillnet fishery as a case study, we (1) model rates of rare-event bycatch and mortality using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation methods and 20 years of observer data; (2) predict unobserved counts of bycatch and mortality; (3) infer expected annual mortality; (4) determine probabilities of mortality exceeding regulatory thresholds; and (5) classify the fishery as having low, medium, or high bycatch impact using those probabilities. We focused on leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Candidate models included Poisson or zero-inflated Poisson likelihood, fishing effort, and a bycatch rate that varied with area, time, or regulatory regime. Regulatory regime had the strongest effect on leatherback bycatch, with the highest levels occurring prior to a regulatory change. Area had the strongest effect on humpback bycatch. Cumulative bycatch estimates for the 20-year period were 104-242 leatherbacks (52-153 deaths) and 6-50 humpbacks (0-21 deaths). The probability of exceeding a regulatory threshold under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (Potential Biological Removal, PBR) of 0.113 humpback deaths was 0.58, warranting a medium bycatch impact classification of the fishery. No PBR thresholds exist for leatherbacks, but the probability of exceeding an anticipated level of two deaths per year, stated as part of a U.S. Endangered Species Act assessment process, was 0.0007. The approach demonstrated here would allow managers to objectively and probabilistically classify fisheries with respect to bycatch impacts on species that have population-relevant mortality reference points, and declare with a stipulated level of certainty that bycatch did or did not exceed estimated upper bounds.","NO"

However, it can often be difficult to identify marked individuals with certainty during resighting surveys, and incomplete identification of marked individuals is potentially a major source of bias in mark-resight abundance estimators. Previously proposed solutions are ad hoc and will tend to underperform unless marked individual identification rates are relatively high (>90%) or individual sighting heterogeneity is negligible. Based on a complete data likelihood, we present an approach that properly accounts for uncertainty in marked individual detection histories when incomplete identifications occur. The models allow for individual heterogeneity in detection, sampling with (e.g. Poisson) or without (e.g. Bernoulli) replacement, and an unknown number of marked individuals. Using a custom Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to facilitate Bayesian inference, we demonstrate these models using two example data sets and investigate their properties via simulation experiments. We estimate abundance for grassland sparrow populations in Pennsylvania, USA when sampling was conducted with replacement and the number of marked individuals was either known or unknown. To increase marked individual identification probabilities, extensive territory mapping was used to assign incomplete identifications to individuals based on location. Despite marked individual identification probabilities as low as 67% in the absence of this territorial mapping procedure, we generally found little return (or need) for this time-consuming investment when using our proposed approach. We also estimate rookery abundance from Alaskan Steller sea lion counts when sampling was conducted without replacement, the number of marked individuals was unknown, and individual heterogeneity was suspected as non-negligible. In terms of estimator performance, our simulation experiments and examples demonstrated advantages of our proposed approach over previous methods, particularly when marked individual identification probabilities are low and individual heterogeneity levels are high.

A probabilistic cost-benefit analysis was performed that includes both costs associated with pond management practices and benefits associated with ESS delivery.

Understanding the spatiotemporal occurrence patterns of spatially structured populations and making biologically realistic long-term predictions of persistence would benefit from the simultaneous treatment of space, demography, and detectability. We integrated these key ideas in a tractable and intuitive way to develop a demographic and spatially realistic patch occupancy model that incorporates components of dispersal, local demographic stage-structure, and detectability. By explicitly relating stage-specific abundances to measurable patch properties, biologically realistic projections of long-term metapopulation dynamics could be made. We applied our model to data from a naturally fragmented population of water voles Arvicola amphibius to describe observed patch occupancy dynamics and to investigate long-term persistence under scenarios of elevated stage-specific local extinction. Accounting for biases induced by imperfect detection, we were able to estimate: stable, and higher than observed metapopulation occupancy; high rates of patch turnover and stage-specific colonization and extinction rates (juvenile and adult, respectively); and juvenile dispersal distances (average 2.10 km). We found that metapopulation persistence in the presence of elevated extinction risk differed depending on which life stage was exposed, and was more sensitive to elevated juvenile rather than adult extinction risk. Predictions of persistence when dynamics are stage-specific suggest that metapopulations may be more resilient to changes in the environment than predicted when relationships are based on patch size approximations rather than population sizes. Our approach allows explicit consideration of local dynamics and dispersal in spatially structured and stage-structured populations, provides a more detailed mechanistic understanding of metapopulation functioning, and can be used to investigate future extinction risk under biologically meaningful scenarios.","NO"

We present an approach for predicting N2O emissions based on a statistical random-effects model: the N2O emission response to applied nitrogen fertilizer is described by an exponential function, the parameters of which are assumed to vary randomly between locations. One of the advantages of this model is that its parameters are easily adjusted to one or several location-specific N2O measurements. The adjusted model can then be used to predict N2O emissions for nitrogen fertilizer doses other than those applied at the considered location. We evaluated the accuracy of model prediction, with real and simulated data. The use of location-specific rather than average predictions reduced prediction errors in most cases. Location-specific predictions could be used to estimate background emission in on-farm studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","NO"

A distinction is made between mechanistic and statistical models, and the relative merits of each are considered. The question of ""when do aquatic systems models provide accurate and useful predictions?"" is addressed, implying some guidelines for model development. It is proposed that, in general, ecological models only provide management-relevant predictions of the behaviour of real systems when there are strong physical (as opposed to chemical or ecological) drivers. Developments over the past 15 years have included changes in technology, changes in the modelling community and changes in the context in which modelling is conducted: the implications of each are briefly discussed. Current trends include increased uptake of best practice guidelines, increasing integration of models, operationalisation, data assimilation, development of improved tools for skill assessment, and application of models to new management questions and in new social contexts. Deeper merging of statistical and mechanistic modelling approaches through such techniques as Bayesian Melding, Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling and surrogate modelling is identified as a key emerging area. Finally, it is suggested that there is a need to systematically identify areas in which our current models are inadequate. We do not yet know for which categories of problems well-implemented aquatic systems models can (or cannot) be expected to accurately predict observational data and system behaviour. This can be addressed through better modelling and publishing practices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","YES"

Many monitoring programmes are successful at monitoring common species, whereas rare species, which are often of highest conservation concern, may be detected infrequently. Study designs that increase the probability of detecting rare species at least once over the study period, while collecting adequate data on common species, strengthen programme ability to address community-wide hypotheses about how an ecosystem functions or responds to management actions. Study design guidelines exist for single-species occupancy models, but practical guidance for monitoring species communities is needed. Single-species population-level designs are necessarily optimal for targeted species, whereas community study designs may be optimal for the assemblage of species, but not for every species within the community. Our objective was to provide a general optimization tool for multi-species models and to illustrate this tool using data from two avian community studies. 2. We conducted a simulation study with a Bayesian hierarchical model to explore design and cost trade-offs for avian community monitoring programmes. We parameterized models using two long-term avian studies from Arizona, USA and evaluated bias and accuracy for different combinations of species in the regional species pool and sampling design combinations of number of sites and sampling occasions. We optimized for maximum accuracy of species richness, detection probability and occupancy probability of rare species, given a fixed budget. 3. Statistical properties for species richness and detection probability of species within the community were driven more by sampling occasions, whereas rare species occupancy probability was influenced more by percentage of area sampled. These results are consistent with results from single-species models, suggesting some similarities between community-level and single-species models with occupancy and detection. 4. Synthesis and applications. Study designs must be cost-efficient while providing reliable knowledge. Researchers and managers have limited funds for collecting data. Our template can be used by researchers and managers to evaluate trade-offs and efficiencies for allocating samples between the number of occasions and sites in multi-species studies, and allow them to identify the optimal study design in order to achieve specific study objectives.","MAYBE"

For several data bases in species distribution modelling (SDM), presences are known but absences are uncertain and can be non-detections. The environment influences both the non-detections and the species occurrences (preferential sampling), affecting model predictions. 2. The objective is to estimate model-based probability of occurrence when absences are uncertain and sampling is preferential. Our Bayesian image restoration (BIR) model has an environmental, spatial and non-detection component. The latter is based on the number of 'control species' (selected by expert knowledge to have wide geographic range and occupy several habitats) observed. Control species are assumed present in all grid cells so an observed absence of the control species is a non-detection. 3. The observed absence of a focal species is likely a non-detection when the environment is conducive, the focal species was observed in the neighbourhood, and the number of control species is small. 4. Simulating an artificial species (true prevalence 0.31) and preferential sampling (observed prevalence 0.18),the BIR modelled prevalence was 0.32 (0.30-0.34). The estimation was robust to failure of assumptions with a mis-specified environmental model. The restored map was close to the true map, and the true realized niche of the species was inferred (with uncertainty). The link between the non-detection and control species is crucial, and a sensitivity analysis is recommended. 5. BIR restored the simulated atlas map more accurately than a covariate adjustment method. When applied to the vascular plant Asarum europaeum L., BIR changed the interpretation. The uncertainty maps assisted decision-making. ABIR implementation new to the SDM field is presented. 6. BIR using control species is most fruitfully applied at coarse scale and intermediate extent, with limited environmental extremes and sufficient expert knowledge (e. g. many Central European countries). 7. BIR is a framework, and we studied one implementation. Any proxy (road density, distance to city, direct expert knowledge, detectability traits, etc.) associated with non-detection can be used so BIR can be applied in diverse settings. Including non-detections reduces model indeterminacy but often requires expert knowledge. However, the benefits of using a priori knowledge and Bayesian estimation are expected to outweigh the risks of model-based inference.","NO"

However, traditional measures for shifts in phenology that are based on observational data likely are biased due to a large influence of population size, observational effort, starting date of a survey, or other causes that may affect the probability of detecting a species. Understanding phenological responses of species to climate change, however, requires a robust measure that could be compared among studies and study years. Here, we developed a new method for estimating arrival and departure dates based on site-occupancy models. Using simulated data, we show that our method provided virtually unbiased estimates of phenological events even if detection probability or the number of sites occupied by the species is changing over time. To illustrate the flexibility of our method, we analyzed spring arrival of two long-distance migrant songbirds and the length of the flight period of two butterfly species, using data from a long-term biodiversity monitoring program in Switzerland.. In contrast to many birds that migrate short distances, the two long-distance migrant songbirds tended to postpone average spring arrival by similar to 0.5 days per year between 1995 and 2012. Furthermore, the flight period of the short-distance-flying butterfly species apparently became even shorter over the study period, while the flight period of the longer-distance-flying butterfly species remained relatively stable. Our method could be applied to temporally and spatially extensive data from a wide range of monitoring programs and citizen science projects, to help unravel how species and communities respond to global warming.","NO"

Temporary migration - where individuals can leave and re-enter a sampled population - is a feature of many capture-mark-recapture (CMR) studies of mobile populations which, if unaccounted for, can lead to biased estimates of population capture probabilities and consequently biased estimates of population abundance. 2. We present a method for incorporating radiotelemetry data within a CMR study to eliminate bias due to temporary migration using a Bayesian state-space model. 3. Our results indicate that using a relatively small number of telemetry tags, it is possible to greatly reduce bias in estimates of capture probabilities using telemetry data to model transition probabilities in and out of the sampling area. In a capture-recapture data set for trout Cod in the Murray river, Australia, accounting for temporary migration led to overall higher estimates of capture probabilities than models assuming permanent or zero migration. Also, individual heterogeneity in detectability can be managed through explicit modelling. We show how accounting for temporary migration when estimating capture probabilities can be used to estimate the abundance and size distribution of a population as though it were closed. 4. Our model provides a basis for more complex models that might integrate telemetry data into other CMR scenarios, thus allowing for greater precision in estimates of vital rates that might otherwise be biased by temporary migration.

Yet, geographically extensive forest inventories have been under-exploited in previous model data fusion efforts. Inventory observations of forest growth, mortality, and biomass integrate processes across a range of timescales, including slow timescale processes such as species turnover, that are likely to have important effects on ecosystem responses to environmental variation. However, the large number (thousands) of inventory plots precludes detailed measurements at each location, so that uncertainty in climate, soil properties, and other environmental drivers may be large. Errors in driver variables, if ignored, introduce bias into model-data fusion. We estimated errors in climate and soil drivers at U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots, and we explored the effects of these errors on model data fusion with the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory LM3V dynamic global vegetation model. When driver errors were ignored or assumed small at FIA plots, responses of biomass production in LM3V to precipitation and soil available water capacity appeared steeper than the corresponding responses estimated from FIA data. These differences became nonsignificant if driver errors at FIA plots were assumed to be large. Ignoring driver errors when optimizing LM3V parameter values yielded estimates for fine-root allocation that were larger than biometric estimates, which is consistent with the expected direction of bias. To explore whether complications posed by driver errors could be circumvented by relying on intensive study sites where driver errors are small, we performed a power analysis. To accurately quantify the response of biomass production to spatial variation in mean annual precipitation within the eastern United States would require at least 40 intensive study sites, which is larger than the number of sites typically available for individual biomes in existing plot networks. Driver errors may be accommodated by several existing model data fusion approaches, including hierarchical Bayesian methods and ensemble filtering methods; however, these methods are computationally expensive.

A practical obstacle to implementing an ABC algorithm is selecting summary statistics and distance metrics that accurately capture the main features of the data. We demonstrate the application of a sequential Monte Carlo ABC sampler (ABC SMC) to parameter estimation of a general stochastic stage-structured population model with ongoing reproduction and heterogeneity in development and mortality. Individual variation in demographic traits has considerable consequences for population dynamics in many systems, but including it in a population model by explicitly allowing stage durations to follow a realistic distribution creates a complex model. We applied the ABC SMC to fit the model to a simulated representative data set with known underlying parameters to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.

The piping plover (Charadrius rnelodus) is a federally-listed shorebird that nests on barrier islands and rapidly responds to changes in its physical environment, making it an excellent species with which to model how shorebird species may respond to habitat change related to sea-level rise and human development. The uncertainty and complexity in predicting sea-level rise, the responses of barrier island habitats to sea-level rise, and the responses of species to sea-level rise and human development necessitate a modeling approach that can link species to the physical habitat features that will be altered by changes in sea level and human development. We used a Bayesian network framework to develop a model that links piping plover nest presence to the physical features of their nesting habitat on a barrier island that is impacted by sea-level rise and human development, using three years of data (1999, 2002, and 2008) from Assateague Island National Seashore in Maryland. Our model performance results showed that we were able to successfully predict nest presence given a wide range of physical conditions within the model's dataset We found that model predictions were more successful when the ranges of physical conditions included in model development were varied rather than when those physical conditions were narrow. We also found that all model predictions had fewer false negatives (nests predicted to be absent when they were actually present in the dataset) than false positives (nests predicted to be present when they were actually absent in the dataset), indicating that our model correctly predicted nest presence better than nest absence. These results indicated that our approach of using a Bayesian network to link specific physical features to nest presence will be useful for modeling impacts of sea-level rise or human-related habitat change on barrier islands. We recommend that potential users of this method utilize multiple years of data that represent a wide range of physical conditions in model development, because the model performed less well when constructed using a narrow range of physical conditions. Further, given that there will always be some uncertainty in predictions of future physical habitat conditions related to sea-level rise and/or human development, predictive models will perform best when developed using multiple, varied years of data input.

The modeling framework uses a hybrid statistical and process based approach to estimate source of pollutants, their transport and decay in the terrestrial and aquatic parts of watersheds. The framework is developed in the ArcGIS environment and is based on the total maximum daily load (TMDL) balance model. Nitrogen (N) is currently addressed in the framework, referred to as WQM-TMDL-N. Loading for each catchment includes non-point sources (NPS) and point sources (PS). The probability of a nutrient load to exceed a target load is evaluated using probabilistic risk assessment, by including the uncertainty associated with export coefficients of various land uses. In an application of this modeling approach to the Tippecanoe River watershed in Indiana, USA, total nitrogen (TN) loading, confidence interval and risk of standard exceedance leading to potential impairment were estimated. Model results suggest that decay coefficients decrease, and delivery fractions increase with increasing stream order. The spatial distribution pattern of delivered incremental TN yield shows a trend similar to that of the delivery fraction in this watershed. The target TN exceedance risk increases considerably when switching from Indiana draft-N benchmark to far lower EPA-proposed TN criteria, suggesting that load reduction to meet the latter criteria may benefit from BMP implementation through source control and delivery reduction.

This approach fails to propagate uncertainty appropriately because it ignores correlations in estimation errors between parameters within a species and differences in estimation error among species. An improved alternative is multi-species mixed-effects modeling, which we approximate using multivariate likelihood profiles in an approach that synthesizes information from several population dynamics models. Simulation modeling demonstrates that this approach has minimal bias, and that precision improves with increased number of species. As a case study, we demonstrate this approach by estimating M/k for 11 groundfish species off the U.S. West Coast using the data and functional forms on which pre-existing, peer-reviewed, population dynamics models are based. M/k is estimated to be 1.26 for Pacific rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), with a coefficient of variation of 76% for M given k. This represents the first-ever estimate of correlations among life history parameters for marine fishes using several age-structured population dynamics models, and it serves as a standard for future life history correlation studies. This approach can be modified to provide robust estimates of other life history parameters and correlations, and requires few changes to existing population dynamics models and software input files for both marine and terrestrial species. Specific results for Pacific rockfishes can be used as a Bayesian prior for estimating natural mortality in future fisheries management efforts. We therefore recommend that fish population dynamics models be compiled in a global database that can be used to simultaneously analyze observation-level data for many species in life history meta-analyses.","NO"

Using survey data for the Southern Ground Hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri) from the Southern African Bird Atlas Project, we compared advantages and disadvantages of three increasingly complex models for species occupancy: an occupancy model that accounted for nondetection but assumed all sites were independent, and two spatial occupancy models that accounted for both nondetection and spatial autocorrelation. We modeled the spatial autocorrelation with an intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) model and with a restricted spatial regression (RSR) model. Both spatial models can readily be applied to any other gridded, presence-absence data set using a newly introduced R package. The RSR model provided the best inference and was able to capture small-scale variation that the other models did not. It showed that ground hornbills are strongly dependent on protected areas in the north of their South African range, but less so further south. The ICAR models did not capture any spatial autocorrelation in the data, and they took an order of magnitude longer than the RSR models to run. Thus, the RSR occupancy model appears to be an attractive choice for modeling occurrences at large spatial domains, while accounting for imperfect detection and spatial autocorrelation.","NO"

Application to tick abundance","ECOLOGICAL MODELLING","2014","10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.12.004","The estimation of animal abundance is essential to understand population dynamics, species interactions and disease patterns in populations. Estimations of relative abundance classically are based on a single observation of several sites. In this case, the mapping of abundance assumes that the probability of detecting an individual, hence the sampling rate, remains constant across the observed sites. In practice, however, this assumption is often not satisfied as the sampling rate may fluctuate between sites due to random fluctuations and/or fluctuations associated with the sampling process, notably associated with the characteristics of the site. It is therefore important to account for variations in detection probability. Using a removal sampling design, we studied the performance of a Bayesian approach to estimate both sampling rates and abundance under the assumption of a closed population. The assumption of a closed population often is weakened when the number of successive samplings is large. The number of samplings has to be limited and optimal. We therefore examined the minimal number of successive samplings needed to achieve sufficient statistical accuracy while respecting underlying model assumptions. Using the same simulations, we also compared the performance of the Bayesian approach to the performance of the frequentist Hayne method based on linear regression. We show that the Bayesian approach proposed gives generally better estimations of population size than the Hayne method. The two methods give approximately the same results for the estimation of sampling rate. We then studied the variability of detection probability of Ixodes ricinus ticks sampled under several environmental conditions by using a hierarchical Bayesian model with a random effect. The estimated sampling rate varied between 33.9% and 47.4% for shrubs and 53.6% and 66.7% for dead leaves. The variability of the sampling rate due to the site decreased when the number of successive samplings considered in the model increased. The variability was lower in dead leaves than shrubs.

We carried out a field seedling transplant experiment to assess not only the direct effects of resources influencing recruitment of four tree species, but also their indirect and combined effects. Our analysis integrated first growing season demographic data together with estimates of mycorrhizal fungal colonization and resource availability (light, soil moisture, and soil nitrogen). Only by considering both the direct and indirect effects of resources we were able to account for most of the variability observed during seedling recruitment. Contrary to expectations, increasing light levels were not always beneficial for recruitment even in low light habitats, and soil moisture availability benefited seedling growth but not survival. In addition, mycorrhizal fungal colonization was not always favored by high light levels or by increasing soil moisture. Seedling survival for all species was lower in plots with higher arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, while the association with ectomycorrhizal fungi varied from beneficial to detrimental. When integrating the direct, indirect, and interactive effects of resource availability and mycorrhizal fungal colonization on tree recruitment dynamics we found that species responded in a nonlinear fashion to increasing resource levels, and we also identified thresholds, i.e., shifts in the direction of the response, along the resource gradient. Our integrated assessment considerably outperformed a null model where only direct effects of resources were accounted for. These results illustrate how the combination of direct, indirect, and combined effects of driving variables better represents the complexity of the processes determining tree species recruitment than simple resource availability mechanisms.","NO"

Models that integrate these factors are likely to better predict the outcomes of natural resource management decisions compared to those that do not take these factors into account. We demonstrate how Bayesian Networks can be used to integrate ecological and social data and expert opinion to model the cost-effectiveness of revegetation activities for restoring biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. We demonstrate our approach with a case-study in grassy woodlands of south-eastern Australia. In our case-study, cost-effectiveness is defined as the improvement in native reptile and beetle species richness achieved per dollar spent on a restoration action. Socio-ecological models predict that weed control, the planting of trees and shrubs, the addition of litter and timber, and the addition of rocks are likely to be the most cost-effective actions for improving reptile and beetle species richness. The cost-effectiveness of restoration actions is lower in remnant and revegetated areas than in cleared areas because of the higher marginal benefits arising from acting in degraded habitats. This result is contingent on having favourable landowner attitudes. Under the best-case landowner demographic scenarios the greatest biodiversity benefits are seen when cleared areas are restored. We find that current restoration investment practices may not be increasing faunal species richness in agricultural landscapes in the most cost-effective way, and that new restoration actions may be necessary. Integrated socio-ecological models support transparent and cost-effective conservation investment decisions. Application of these models highlights the importance of collecting both social and ecological data when attempting to understand and manage socio-ecological systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyzed time series of detection/nondetection data using hierarchical models in a Bayesian multi-model inference framework to decompose the dynamics of species distributions into responses to environmental variability, spatial variation in habitat conditions, and population dynamics and interspecific interactions, while correcting for observation errors and variation in sampling regimes. We modeled distribution dynamics of 14 waterbird species (broadly defined, including wetland and riparian species) using data from two different breeding bird surveys collected in the Boreal Shield ecozone within Ontario, Canada. Temporal variation in species occupancy (2000-2006) was primarily driven by climatic variability. Only two species showed evidence of consistent temporal trends in distribution: Ring-necked Duck (Aythya collaris) decreased, and Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) increased. The models had good predictive ability on independent data over time (1997-1999). Spatial variation in species occupancy was strongly related to the distribution of specific land cover types and habitat disturbance: Fire and forest harvesting influenced occupancy more than did roads, settlements, or mines. Bioclimatic and habitat heterogeneity indices and geographic coordinates exerted negligible influence on most species distributions. Estimated habitat suitability indices had good predictive ability on spatially independent data (Hudson Bay Lowlands ecozone). Additionally, we detected effects of interspecific interactions. Species responses to fire and forest harvesting were similar for 13 of 14 species; thus, forest-harvesting practices in Ontario generally appeared to emulate the effects of fire for waterbirds over timescales of 10-20 years. Extrapolating to all 84 waterbird species breeding on the Ontario Boreal Shield, however, suggested that up to 30 species may instead have altered (short-term) distribution dynamics due to forestry practices. Hence, natural disturbances are critical components of the ecology of the boreal forest and forest practices which aim to approximate them may succeed in allowing the maintenance of the associated species, but improved monitoring and modeling of large-scale boreal forest bird distribution dynamics will be necessary to resolve existing uncertainties, especially on less-common species.","NO"

However, there has been little independent evaluation of the precision and accuracy of the life history values in global and publicly available databases. We therefore develop a novel method based on a Bayesian errors-in-variables model that compares database entries with estimates from local experts, and we illustrate this process by assessing the accuracy and precision of entries in FishBase, one of the largest and oldest life history databases. This model distinguishes biases among seven life history parameters, two types of information available in FishBase (i.e., published values and those estimated from other parameters), and two taxa (i.e., bony and cartilaginous fishes) relative to values from regional experts in the United States, while accounting for additional variance caused by sex- and region-specific life history traits. For published values in FishBase, the model identifies a small positive bias in natural mortality and negative bias in maximum age, perhaps caused by unacknowledged mortality caused by fishing. For life history values calculated by FishBase, the model identified large and inconsistent biases. The model also demonstrates greatest precision for body size parameters, decreased precision for values derived from geographically distant populations, and greatest between-sex differences in age at maturity. We recommend that our bias and precision estimates be used in future errors-in-variables models as a prior on measurement errors. This approach is broadly applicable to global databases of life history traits and, if used, will encourage further development and improvements in these databases.","MAYBE"

Such models are widely used to infer community dynamics of sessile organisms because transition probabilities (the elements of transition probability matrices) can be estimated with time series data from grid sampling, where species occupancy states are assessed at multiple fixed points in a quadrat or transect. These estimates, however, are known to be biased when resampling error exists. In this study, we used the perspective of multistate dynamic occupancy models to develop a new Markov model that is structured hierarchically such that transitions among occupancy states and observation processes are considered explicitly at each fixed point. We show that, by adopting a hierarchical Bayesian approach, our model provides estimates for transition probabilities that are robust to sampling error. We also show that error rate may be estimated without additional data obtained from rapid repeated sampling. Considerations for the analysis for the application to real data set and potential extensions of the proposed model are discussed.","NO"

It is a challenge to achieve reliable estimates of distribution trends from them, because opportunistic citizen science data may suffer from changes in field efforts over time (observation bias), from incomplete and selective recording by observers (reporting bias) and from geographical bias. These, in addition to detection bias, may lead to spurious trends. We investigated whether occupancy models can correct for the observation, reporting and detection biases in opportunistic data. Occupancy models use detection/nondetection data and yield estimates of the percentage of occupied sites (occupancy) per year. These models take the imperfect detection of species into account. By correcting for detection bias, they may simultaneously correct for observation and reporting bias as well. We compared trends in occupancy (or distribution) of butterfly and dragonfly species derived from opportunistic data with those derived from standardized monitoring data. All data came from the same grid squares and years, in order to avoid any geographical bias in this comparison. Distribution trends in opportunistic and monitoring data were well-matched. Strong trends observed in monitoring data were rarely missed in opportunistic data.Synthesis and applications. Opportunistic data can be used for monitoring purposes if occupancy models are used for analysis. Occupancy models are able to control for the common biases encountered with opportunistic data, enabling species trends to be monitored for species groups and regions where it is not feasible to collect standardized data on a large scale. Opportunistic data may thus become an important source of information to track distribution trends in many groups of species.","NO"

Phylogenetic trees that include all member lineages are necessary for many questions in macroevolution, biogeography and conservation. Currently, producing such trees when genetic data or phenotypic characters for some tips are missing generally involves assigning missing species to the root of their most exclusive clade, essentially grafting them onto existing and static topologies as polytomies. 2. We describe an R package, PASTIS', that enables a two-stage Bayesian method using MrBayes version 3.2 (or higher) to incorporate lineages lacking genetic data at the tree inference stage. The inputs include a consensus topology, a set of taxonomic statements (e.g. placing species in genera and aligning some genera with each other or placing subspecies within species) and user-defined priors on edge lengths and topologies. PASTIS produces input files for execution in MrBayes that will produce a posterior distribution of complete ultrametric trees that captures uncertainty under a homogeneous birth-death prior model of diversification and placement constraints. If the age distribution of a focal node is known (e.g. from fossils), the ultrametric tree distribution can be converted to a set of dated trees. We also provide functions to visualize the placement of missing taxa in the posterior distribution. 3. The PASTIS approach is not limited to the level of species and could equally be applied to higher or lower levels of organization (e.g. accounting for all recognized subspecies or populations within a species) given an appropriate choice of priors on branching times.","NO"

Bayesian analysts often use a constant prior for N, the choice motivated by a desire to avoid an informative prior, and to let the data speak for themselves. For instance, data augmentation methods for model M-h posit a super-population of size M >> N with individual detection probabilities z(i)p(i), with p(i) sampled from a parametric family of interest, and z(i) an indicator of membership in the target population; thus, N = Sigma(i)z(i). Treating z(i) as independent Bernoulli trials with success rate and assigning a uniform prior to is equivalent to assigning a discrete uniform prior for N on {0,1,2, ... , M}; by setting M large enough, analysts approximate the improper constant prior on the positive integers. In this paper, I demonstrate some paradoxical and plainly unacceptable features of the constant prior.

Although insects are a species-rich group and are important for ecosystem functioning, they have been largely neglected in conservation studies and policies, mainly due to technical and methodological constraints. Sound detection, a nondestructive method, is easily applied within a citizen-science framework and could be an interesting solution for insect monitoring. However, it has not yet been tested at a large scale. We assessed the value of a citizen-science program in which Orthoptera species (Tettigoniidae) were monitored acoustically along roads. We used Bayesian model-averaging analyses to test whether we could detect widely known patterns of anthropogenic effects on insects, such as the negative effects of urbanization or intensive agriculture on Orthoptera populations and communities. We also examined site-abundance correlations between years and estimated the biases in species detection to evaluate and improve the protocol. Urbanization and intensive agricultural landscapes negatively affected Orthoptera species richness, diversity, and abundance. This finding is consistent with results of previous studies of Orthoptera, vertebrates, carabids, and butterflies. The average mass of communities decreased as urbanization increased. The dispersal ability of communities increased as the percentage of agricultural land and, to a lesser extent, urban area increased. Despite changes in abundances over time, we found significant correlations between yearly abundances. We identified biases linked to the protocol (e.g., car speed or temperature) that can be accounted for ease in analyses. We argue that acoustic monitoring of Orthoptera along roads offers several advantages for assessing Orthoptera biodiversity at large spatial and temporal extents, particularly in a citizen science framework.

Steinhorst & Samuel (Biometrics 1989; 45, 415-425) showed how logistic regression models, fit to detection data collected from radiocollared animals, can be used to estimate and adjust for visibility bias in wildlife population surveys. Population abundance is estimated using a modified Horvitz-Thompson (mHT) estimator in which counts of observed animal groups are divided by their estimated inclusion probabilities (determined by plot-level sampling probabilities and detection probabilities estimated from radiocollared individuals). The sampling distribution of the mHT estimator is typically right-skewed, and statistical inference relies on asymptotic theory that may not be appropriate with small samples. 2. We develop an alternative, Bayesian model-based approach which we apply to data collected from moose (Alces alces) in Minnesota. We model detection probabilities as a function of visual obstruction, informed by data from 124 sightability trials involving radiocollared moose. These sightability data, along with counts of moose from a stratified random sample of aerial plots, are used to estimate moose abundance in 2006 and 2007 and the log rate of change between the 2 years. 3. Unlike traditional design-based estimators, model-based estimators require assumptions regarding stratum-specific distributions of the detection covariates, the number of animal groups per plot and the number of animals per animal group. We demonstrate numerical and graphical methods for assessing the validity of these assumptions and compare two different models for the distribution of the number of animal groups per plot, a beta-binomial model and a logistic-t model. 4. Estimates of the log rate of change (95% CI) between 2006 and 2007 were -0<bold>21</bold> (-0<bold>53</bold>, 0<bold>12</bold>), -0<bold>24</bold> (-0<bold>64</bold>, 0<bold>16</bold>), and -0<bold>25</bold> (-0<bold>64</bold>, 0<bold>15</bold>) for the beta-binomial model, logistic-t model and mHT estimator, respectively. Plots of posterior-predictive distributions and goodness-of-fit measures both suggest the beta-binomial model provides a better fit to the data. 5. The Bayesian framework offers many inferential advantages, including the ability to incorporate prior information and perform exact inference with small samples. More importantly, the model-based approach provides additional flexibility when designing and analysing multi-year surveys (e.g. rotational sampling designs could be used to focus sampling effort in important areas, and random effects could be used to share information across years).","NO"

This paper reviews five common approaches or model types that have the capacity to integrate knowledge by developing models that can accommodate multiple issues, values, scales and uncertainty considerations, as well as facilitate stakeholder engagement. The approaches considered are: systems dynamics, Bayesian networks, coupled component models, agent-based models and knowledge-based models (also referred to as expert systems). We start by discussing several considerations in model development, such as the purpose of model building, the availability of qualitative versus quantitative data for model specification, the level of spatio-temporal detail required, and treatment of uncertainty. These considerations and a review of applications are then used to develop a framework that aims to assist modellers and model users in the choice of an appropriate modelling approach for their integrated assessment applications and that enables more effective learning in interdisciplinary settings.

Structurally, the network comprised one primary transport factor, one primary source factor and three post-mobilisation strategies, and three output factors. In general the network suggests that N exports are more sensitive to transport factors (i.e. runoff volumes) than source factors (i.e. fertiliser application rates) although the cumulative effects of excessive fertiliser were not considered. Post-mobilisation mitigations such as wetlands and ecoditches appear to be particularly effective in decreasing N exports however their implementation on a regional scale may be limited by land availability. While optimising N inputs would be prudent, the network suggests that better irrigation practice, including improved irrigation scheduling, using less imported water and optimising rainfall utilisation would be more effective in achieving environmental goals than simply limiting N supply.

We also integrated the expressed views into a meta-model using the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method. In task two, we used influence diagrams to study qualitatively how the stakeholders frame the management problem of the herring fishery and elucidate what kind of causalities the different views involve. The paper combines these two tasks to assess the suitability of the methodological choices to participatory modeling in terms of both a modeling tool and participation mode.

It is concluded that the subjective perspective to knowledge, that is fundamental in Bayesian theory, suits participatory modeling better than a positivist paradigm that seeks the objective truth. The methodology provides a flexible tool that can be adapted to different kinds of needs and challenges of participatory modeling.

Such models require presence-absence data to be collected at spatially indexed survey units. However, only recently have researchers recognized the need to correct for spatially induced overdisperison by explicitly accounting for spatial autocorrelation in occupancy probability. Previous efforts to incorporate such autocorrelation have largely focused on logit-normal formulations for occupancy, with spatial autocorrelation induced by a random effect within a hierarchical modeling framework. Although useful, computational time generally limits such an approach to relatively small data sets, and there are often problems with algorithm instability, yielding unsatisfactory results. Further, recent research has revealed a hidden form of multicollinearity in such applications, which may lead to parameter bias if not explicitly addressed. Combining several techniques, we present a unifying hierarchical spatial occupancy model specification that is particularly effective over large spatial extents. This approach employs a probit mixture framework for occupancy and can easily accommodate a reduced-dimensional spatial process to resolve issues with multicollinearity and spatial confounding while improving algorithm convergence. Using open-source software, we demonstrate this new model specification using a case study involving occupancy of caribou (Rangifer tarandus) over a set of 1080 survey units spanning a large contiguous region ( 108 000 km(2)) in northern Ontario, Canada.

We analyzed our data using a Bayesian spatially explicit capture recapture model (SECR) with sex covariates to account for differences in home range size and detection probabilities of male and female jaguars. As several of our camera grids where too small for reliable density estimates, we used estimates for the sigma parameter from the largest camera grid to correct for the bias. Density estimates for our surveys were similar with an average density of 4.4 +/- 0.7 jaguar 100 km(-2). Both home range size and encounter rates varied significantly between sexes with males having a larger home range and higher encounter rate than females. Our estimated sex ratio was 1:1.5 compared to an observed ratio of 1.9:1. Not accounting for sex would have resulted in an underestimation of the true density.

Different performance measures (mean absolute error, coefficient of determination, etc.) were adopted to evaluate and compare the performance of SUM and BHM. Relevant input factors related to VOC dispersion were stepwise selected with the BHM. Both modeling techniques identified seasonal as well as spatial variations of benzene, with the highest concentrations occurring in winter and the lowest in summer.

However, there is a huge lack of knowledge concerning the precision of AGB estimates and the sources of this uncertainty. At the tree level, the tree height is predicted using the tree diameter at breast height (DBH) and a height sub-model. The wood-specific gravity (WSG) is predicted with taxonomic information and a WSG sub-model. The tree mass is predicted using the predicted height, the predicted WSG and the biomass sub-model. Our models were inferred with Bayesian methods and the uncertainty propagated with a Monte Carlo scheme. The uncertainties in the predictions of tree height, tree WSG and tree mass were neglected sequentially to quantify their contributions to the uncertainty in AGB. The study was conducted in French Guiana where long-term research on forest ecosystems provided an outstanding data collection on tree height, tree dynamics, tree mass and species WSG. We found that the uncertainty in the AGB estimates was found to derive primarily from the biomass sub-model. The models used to predict the tree heights and WSG contributed negligible uncertainty to the final estimate. Considering our results, a poor knowledge of WSG and the heightdiameter relationship does not increase the uncertainty in AGB estimates. However, it could lead to bias. Therefore, models and databases should be used with care. This study provides a methodological framework that can be broadly used by foresters and plant ecologist. It provides the accurate confidence intervals associated with forest AGB estimates made from inventory data. When estimating region-scale AGB values (through spatial interpolation, spatial modelling or satellite signal treatment), the uncertainty of the forest AGB value in the reference forest plots has to be taken in account. We believe that in the light of the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation debate, our method is a crucial step in monitoring carbon stocks and their spatio-temporal evolution.","MAYBE"

Because of uncertainties in radar measurements and the relationship between radar measurements and rainfall on the ground, radar-rainfall data are often combined with rain gauge data to improve their accuracy. However, while rain gauges can provide accurate estimates of rainfall, their data are sometimes corrupted with errors caused by the environment in which the gauges are deployed. This study develops a real-time method for identifying measurement errors in rain gauge data streams. This method employs a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) model of the rain gauge data stream to sequentially forecast the next rain gauge measurement from both the rain gauge and weather radar data streams and a decision rule-based classifier to identify data errors. Because of the uncertainty in the relationship between the radar and rainfall measurements, this method uses a statistical learning method (expectation maximization) to determine the best parameters for this relationship, given an adaptively sized moving window of previous measurements. The performance of the error detector developed in this study is demonstrated using a precipitation sensor network composed of five telemetered tipping bucket rain gauges and a WSR-88D weather radar. Through an analysis using synthetic errors, the false alarm rate and false negative rate were calculated to be 0.90% and 1.5%, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","NO"

Ideally, enough information will be collected to enable management strategy evaluations on the stock, providing guidance on future management decisions. In many fisheries management agencies, however, the ability to rapidly and cost-effectively build and run models to evaluate management strategies is as much an impediment to their development as the lack of data. The BIOMAS software provides users with the ability to rapidly develop single or multi-species, length-based population dynamics models for the exploration of alternative management strategies in a Bayesian-based framework. The system is theoretically capable of incorporating any number of species, fishing fleets and spatial compartments in a single model. Further complexity is provided with the ability to implement management and environmental effects on stocks as well as the tracking of economic costs and revenue from fishing activity. However, in practice model complexity will be limited by the needs of the modelling project, by the availability of data and by the modelling project timeline. By incorporating Bayesian methods, including prior probability distributions, the BIOMAS system enables users to explore the uncertainty surrounding a limited number of parameter values and to incorporate this uncertainty into the model results. Sensitivity analyses can be run against virtually all model parameters providing insight into the key drivers for the model and likely candidates for Bayesian priors. A number of management indicators are provided for all stocks and fleets in the model including stock depletion, catch weights, age- and length-frequencies, discard mortality estimates and fleet profits - each with Bayesian-based confidence intervals. Such indicators become the primary means of comparing the effectiveness of alternative management strategies when using the system forecasting capabilities. Through the inclusion of stochastic processes, such as process error and environmental and pricing fluctuations, each management strategy can also be evaluated for its robustness to such uncertainty. The ability to reflect more of our uncertainty in modelled outcomes, which tools such as BIOMAS provide, can unfortunately come at the expense of clarity in the outcomes. This is only because these models better encompass our lack of knowledge about fishery systems. Fortunately, such modelling tools can also provide us with a clearer understanding of the main sources of this uncertainty. Furthermore, the unique design of the BIOMAS system allows users to undertake 'research strategy evaluations' in which the costs and benefits of different forms of research can be compared, allowing managers and research leaders to see more clearly the benefits of targeted research to reduce these uncertainties.

Imperfect detection can seriously bias conventional estimators of species distributions and species richness. Plant traits, survey-specific conditions and site-specific characteristics may influence plant detection probability. However, the generality of the problems induced by imperfect detection in plants and the magnitude of this challenge for plant distribution studies are currently unknown. 2. We address this question based on data from the Swiss Biodiversity Monitoring, in which vascular plants are surveyed twice in the same year along a 2.5-km transect in 451 1-km(2) quadrats. Overall, 1700 species were recorded. We chose a random sample of 100 species from the 1700 species to determine general detection levels. To examine the relationship of covariates on detection, we chose a stratified random sample of 100 species from 886 species that were detected in at least 18 locations, with 25 each from four life-forms (LF): grass, forb, shrub and tree. Using a Bayesian multispecies site-occupancy model, we estimated occurrence and detection probability of these species and their relation to covariates. 3. Based on the random sample of 100 species, detection probability during the first survey ranged 0.03-0.99 (median 0.74) and during the second survey, 0.03-0.99 (median 0.82). Based on the stratified random sample of 100 species, detection probability during the first survey ranged 0.02-0.99 (median 0.87) and during the second survey, 0.01-1 (median 0.89). Detection probability differed slightly among the four LFs. In 60 species, survey season or elevation had significant effects on detection. We illustrated detection probability maps for Switzerland based on the modelled relationships with environmental covariates. 4. Synthesis. Our findings suggest that even in a standardized monitoring program, imperfect detection of plants may be common. With the absence of a correction for detection errors, maps in plant distribution studies will be confounded with spatial patterns in detection probability. We presume that these problems will be much more widespread in the data sets that are used for conventional plant species distribution modelling. Imperfect detection should be estimated, even in distribution studies of plants and other sessile organisms, to better control detection errors that may compromise the results of species distribution studies.","MAYBE"

Knowledge of a species' likely response to natural as well as synthetic shocks will assist in effective species management. Statistically this is a challenging problem which does not usually admit closed-form mathematical analysis. Consequently, many people have used Bayesian methods to fit state space models of density dependence to many different species, of which we take eleven species of North American duck as our motivating examples. A Bayesian analysis requires a choice of model and parameter prior. The latter is difficult to do without inducing bias in model selection, and we attempt to address this problem. Our priors will be obtained by considering which parameter values are representative of features we expect to see in the data, and which would produce unnatural behaviour. To fit the models, we use a novel sequential Monte Carlo method (particle learning) not previously applied to ecological data sets. We show that existing analyses on the duck data may have been susceptible to a common problem in Bayesian model selection (Lindley's paradox), and suggest methods for prior selection which mitigate this issue. We also discover that although it is possible to detect the existence of density dependence, it is unrealistic to expect to determine the time lag over which it operates without a great deal of data, even if said data are simulated from the model. We demonstrate that prior choices motivated by the above considerations can lead to substantially increased predictive accuracy over surprisingly long time scales whether model selection is of primary concern or not. We conclude from our analysis of real-world data that there is little evidence of density dependence in many duck species, suggesting that such effects, if present, are likely to be small in magnitude.","YES"

However, most series represent fluctuations around K without extending to low abundances and are thus uninformative about rm. We used informative prior distributions of maximum population growth rate, p(rm), to estimate Bayesian posterior distributions in Ricker and theta-logistic models fitted to abundance series for 36 mammal species. We also used state-space models to account for observation errors. We used two data sets of population growth rates from different mammal species with associated allometry (body mass) and demography (age at first reproduction) data to predict rm prior distributions. We assessed patterns of differences in posterior means (rm) from models fitted with and without informative priors and used the deviance information criterion (DIC) to rank models for each species. Differences in posterior rm from models with informative vs. vague priors co-varied with the prior mean (rm) for Ricker models, but only posterior theta co-varied with prior rm in theta-logistic models. Informative-prior Ricker models ranked higher than (81% of species), or equivalent to (all species), those with vague priors, which decreased to 70% ranking higher for state-space models. Prior information also improved the precision of rm by 13-45% depending on model and prior. Posterior rm were highly sensitive to rm priors for theta-logistic models (halving and doubling prior mean gave -56% and 95% changes in rm, respectively) and less sensitive for Ricker models (-25% and 35% changes in rm). Our results show that fitting density-feedback models without prior information gives biologically unrealistic rm estimates in most cases, even from simple Ricker models. However, sensitivity analysis shows that high rm - theta correlation in theta-logistic models means the fit is largely determined by the prior, precluding the use of this model for most census data. Our findings are supported by applying models to simulated time series of abundance. Prior knowledge of species' life history can provide more ecologically realistic estimates (matching theoretical predictions) of regulatory dynamics even in the absence of detailed demographic data, thereby potentially improving predictions of extinction risk.","YES"

In this paper, we use a Bayesian state space framework (BSSF) to estimate parameters of a discrete time model from a mark-recapture data set of age-1 juvenile Atlantic salmon. We use a Gaussian process (GP) based approach to model variation in seasonal growth potential. In addition, we use auxiliary information on the food environment as prior knowledge of seasonal fluctuations in growth. Parameters for the GP prior and measurement error variances were fixed to speed convergence. Posterior estimates of model parameters were relatively insensitive to these choices. Our model captures the seasonal growth dynamics of juvenile Atlantic salmon as evidenced by close agreement between observed and predicted lengths (r(2) = 0.98). In addition, the relatively narrow confidence intervals indicated significant learning in the parameters of interest. Finally, our model approach was able to accurately recover missing data points. Although this model was applied to a mark-recapture dataset of Atlantic salmon, the generality of the approach should make it applicable to a wide variety of size trajectory datasets, and thus, provides a useful tool to estimate individual and temporal variability in growth from datasets with repeated measurements.

Such estimates are paramount for generating reliable estimates of animal abundance and are sometimes of biological interest in their own right (e.g. for characterizing pinniped haul-out behaviour or landbird singing frequency). We consider the estimation of availability probability from telemetry data when there are missing records. When records are missing-completely-at-random (i.e. not influenced by whether an animal is available for sampling or other covariates), approaches that censor missing records result in unbiased estimates of availability probability. However, censoring such records can result in bias when data are not missing-completely-at-random. We present a novel Bayesian temporal availability model that can be used to explicitly account for the process by which missing data arise. Our approach couples an underlying model for the partially observed availability process together with an observation model that allows state-dependent probabilities of missingness. This approach provides relatively unbiased estimates of availability probability even in the face of violations of the missing-at-random assumption. A new R package, TempOcc, is introduced to automate estimation. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by analysing both simulated data and hourly satellite telemetry records for 157 ice-associated seals in the Bering Sea, for which 27% of records were missing. In this case, we were interested in generating unbiased estimates of haul-out probabilities. Such probabilities are necessary when estimating abundance from aerial survey counts and assessing possible changes in seal phenology. Our analysis indicates that the missing-at-random assumption is indeed violated in telemetry studies of phocid seals in the Bering Sea. However, estimates of availability probability do not depend critically on this assumption. We recommend that ecologists routinely consider the implications of violating the missing-at-random assumption when estimating availability probabilities. Where possible, the modelling framework articulated in this study can be used to diagnose and correct for violations of the missing-at-random assumption.","MAYBE"

For this reason, their results are affected by systematic errors. This bias makes it difficult to get reliable uncertainty estimates of model parameters and predictions. A relatively simple way of considering this bias when using deterministic models is to add a statistical representation of the bias to the model output in addition to observation error and to jointly estimate model parameters, bias and observation error. When assuming Normal distributions for bias and observation error, this leads to a relatively simple likelihood function that can easily be evaluated. Nevertheless, the sampling from the posterior distribution still requires long Markov chains to be calculated which can be prohibitive for computationally demanding models. In order to extend the range of applicability of this technique to computationally demanding models, we suggest to replace Markov chain sampling by a Normal approximation to the posterior of the parameters and to estimate prediction uncertainty by linearized error propagation. We tested this procedure for a didactical example and for an application of the biogeochemical-ecological lake model BELAMO to long-term data from Lake Zurich. This is a good test application because the strong coupling of output variables makes it difficult to avoid bias in the results of this model. These tests demonstrate the applicability of the suggested procedure, the approximate reproduction of the results of the full procedure for the didactical example, and meaningful results for the lake model. For the latter, the results demonstrate that the assumption of a realistic likelihood function leads to the conclusion that prediction uncertainty may be high. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To determine optimal management strategies, it is essential to understand species-habitat relationships and how species habitat use is related to natural or human-induced environmental changes. Using five years of monitoring data in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, Maryland, USA, we developed four multispecies hierarchical models for estimating amphibian wetland use that account for imperfect detection during sampling. The models were designed to determine which factors (wetland habitat characteristics, annual trend effects, spring/summer precipitation, and previous wetland occupancy) were most important for predicting future habitat use. We used the models to make predictions about species occurrences in sampled and unsampled wetlands and evaluated model projections using additional data. Using a Bayesian approach, we calculated a posterior distribution of receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) values, which allowed us to explicitly quantify the uncertainty in the quality of our predictions and to account for false negatives in the evaluation data set. We found that wetland hydroperiod (the length of time that a wetland holds water), as well as the occurrence state in the prior year, were generally the most important factors in determining occupancy. The model with habitat-only covariates predicted species occurrences well; however, knowledge of wetland use in the previous year significantly improved predictive ability at the community level and for two of 12 species/species complexes. Our results demonstrate the utility of multispecies models for understanding which factors affect species habitat use of an entire community (of species) and provide an improved methodology using AUC that is helpful for quantifying the uncertainty in model predictions while explicitly accounting for detection biases.","NO"

We explore approaches to probabilistic uncertainty specification including direct elicitation and Bayesian analysis. In particular, we introduce the generic technique of elaboration and present a variety of forms of elaboration, illustrated with a series of examples. The methods are applied to the expression of uncertainty in a case study. Mechanistic models are built in just about every area of science and technology, to represent complex physical processes. They are used to predict, understand and control those processes, and increasingly play a role in national and international policy making. As such models gain higher prominence, recipients of their forecasts are increasingly demanding to know how accurate they are. There is therefore a growing interest in quantifying the uncertainties in model predictions. Uncertainty in model outputs, as representations of reality, arise from uncertainty about model inputs (such as initial conditions, external forcing variables and parameters in model equations) and from uncertainty about model structure. Our case study is based on the Sheffield Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (SDGVM), which is used to estimate the combined carbon flux from vegetation in England and Wales in a given year.

The model allows assessing the effect of density both on the population growth rate as well as the demographic parameters while accounting for imperfect detection. We studied the performance of this model using simulation and illustrate its use with data on red-backed shrikes Lanius collurio.

Does the combination of several models of different complexity improve our capacity to synthesize different perceptions of the ecosystem functioning and therefore the value of the modelling enterprise in the context of ecosystem management? Our study addresses this question using a complex (14 state-variable) eutrophication model along with a simpler modelling construct that considers the interplay among phosphate, detritus. and generic phytoplankton and zooplankton state variables. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate the relative mean standard error to assess the posterior support of the two models after considering the available data from the system.

Finally, the discrepancy between the chlorophyll a predictions of the two models pinpoint the need to delve into the dynamics of phosphorus in the sediment-water column interface, as the internal nutrient loading can conceivably be a regulatory factor of the duration of the transient phase and the recovery resilience of the system.

The denser the grid of available gauged data locations the smaller become the kriging variances and the better become the kriging predictions. Unfortunately, for the task of optimal planning prior to data gathering where to locate the monitoring stations or samples almost no software is freely available up to date. This article reports on a MATLAB and Octave toolbox whose main task is the optimal planning of monitoring networks. Both, addition of sampling locations to available networks and the reduction of monitoring networks are considered in an optimal way by means of borrowing ideas from convex experimental design theory and regression models with random coefficients. Both, design criteria for optimal interpolation with the covariance function assumed to be fixed and certain as well as a criterion where the uncertainty of the covariance function estimation is taken into account are developed and optimal designs are calculated by means of deterministic algorithms that fully make use of the mathematical structure of the considered design criteria.

Capturerecapture mixture models are important tools in evolution and ecology to estimate demographic parameters and abundance while accounting for individual heterogeneity. A key step is to select the correct number of mixture components i) to provide unbiased estimates that can be used as reliable proxies of fitness or ingredients in management strategies and ii) classify individuals into biologically meaningful classes. However, there is no consensus method in the statistical literature for selecting the number of components. 2. In ecology, most studies rely on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) that has recently gained attention in ecology. The Integrated Completed Likelihood criterion (ICL; IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2000, 22, 719) was specifically developed to favour well-separated components, but its use has never been investigated in ecology. 3. We compared the performance of AIC, BIC and ICL for selecting the number of components with regard to a) bias and accuracy of survival and detection estimates and b) success in selecting the true number of components using extensive simulations and data on wolf (Canis lupus) that were used for management through survival and abundance estimation. 4. Bias in survival and detection estimates was <0.02 for both AIC and BIC, and more than 0.09 for ICL, while mean square error was <0.05 for all criteria. As expected, bias increased as heterogeneity increased. Success rates of AIC and BIC in selecting the true number of components were better than ICL (68% for AIC, 58% for BIC, and 16% for ICL). As the degree of heterogeneity increased, AIC (and BIC in a lesser extent) overestimated the number of components, while ICL often underestimated this number. For the wolf study, the 2-class model was selected by BIC and ICL, while AIC could not decide between the 2- and 3-class models. 5. We recommend using AIC or BIC when the aim is to estimate parameters. Regarding classification, we suggest taking the classification quality into account by using ICL in conjunction with BIC, pending further work to adapt its penalty term for capturerecapture data.","MAYBE"

Both are known to be a function of distance from the seed trees. Seed densities usually decline with distance from the seed trees and the survival function can have different shapes. It may e.g. increase with distance (Janzen-Connell type effects) or decrease in the case of facilitation. In recruitment modeling the dispersal kernel is often directly fitted to the number of saplings instead of to the number of seeds, by indirectly assuming a distance-invariant survival function. This assumption may be violated in many cases as the survival function may attain different shapes. The interaction of distance-dependent seed deposition and survival becomes more complex in the case of several seed trees, since processes shaping the survival function may act on seeds from different seed trees. We develop a recruitment model disentangling (1) seed dispersal as derived by a summed seed shadow model and (2) survival as a function of distance of several nearby seed trees. Using Bayesian model inversion we parameterize our model for post fire Pinus sylvestris regeneration, which is known to suffer from strong root competition in the vicinity of seed trees. We show that accounting for distance-dependent survival substantially improves the model performance for three tested seed dispersal kernels. We show that ignoring distance-dependency of survival leads to ecologically unrealistic parameter estimates, questionable seed dispersal properties and biased sapling density predictions at the landscape level. Disentangling seed dispersal and survival processes is essential for modeling recruitment patterns in the case of distance-dependent survival. Our model helps to learn about the connection between seed and sapling patterns particularly when several seed trees are present. Our modeling approach derives separate seed dispersal kernels, survival functions, and the resulting recruitment-patterns, also when only sapling counts are available. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

During aerial or boat-based surveys for large-bodied diving taxa (e.g. marine mammals and marine turtles), a proportion of animals present will be missed because they are submerged and out of view, leading to availability bias in abundance indices. Information on divesurfacing patterns can improve corrections for availability bias. However, as dive data are typically limited, availability correction factors are often based on poorly resolved dive and surface times, and diving heterogeneity is not considered. 2. We collected dive records for green turtles Chelonia mydas, Linnaeus 1758, and loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta, Linnaeus 1758, on a foraging ground in Shark Bay, Western Australia to quantify dive-surfacing patterns and assess potential correlations with easily measured environmental features: habitat depth and water temperature. Bayesian regression models were used to predict dive and surface interval durations across temperature-depth gradients and assess their uncertainty. We used these predictions to quantify variation in availability correction factors, which were multipliers designed, in this case, to adjust surface sightings data to incorporate diving animals. 3. Dive and surface interval durations for both species varied positively with depth and negatively with temperature, consistent with a priori expectations, although temperature effects were not always significant. Dive metrics were predictable, although uncertainty increased in deeper habitat with few observed dives. 4. Availability correction factors were highly heterogeneous, with larger corrections necessary in colder, deeper conditions (long-diving, infrequent surfacing behaviour) and smaller corrections required in warmer, shallower conditions (short-diving, frequent-surfacing behaviour). 5. Predictable variation in the diving behaviour of chelonid sea turtles across environmental gradients on a foraging ground reveals that site-specific knowledge of dive-surfacing patterns can be important to mitigate the effects of availability bias during population surveys. Accounting for such trends may improve the reliability of ecological inferences (e. g. spatiotemporal distribution trends) and the efficacy of applications (e. g. conservation planning) based on survey data.","NO"

We refer to predictions by experts of what may happen in a particular context as expert judgments. In general, an expert-elicitation approach consists of five steps: deciding how information will be used, determining what to elicit, designing the elicitation process, performing the elicitation, and translating the elicited information into quantitative statements that can be used in a model or directly to make decisions. This last step is known as encoding. Some of the considerations in eliciting expert knowledge include determining how to work with multiple experts and how to combine multiple judgments, minimizing bias in the elicited information, and verifying the accuracy of expert information. We highlight structured elicitation techniques that, if adopted, will improve the accuracy and information content of expert judgment and ensure uncertainty is captured accurately. We suggest four aspects of an expert elicitation exercise be examined to determine its comprehensiveness and effectiveness: study design and context, elicitation design, elicitation method, and elicitation output.

Here, a 1-D model, driven by 3-D model output, is developed to provide an efficient test-bed environment in which model parameters are estimated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. The spatial and temporal uncertainty of model predictions due to parameter estimation error is quantified. A simple ecosystem model is calibrated for Lake Superior that is capable of reproducing most of the major features in observed concentration profiles of nutrients, dissolved organic carbon, and chlorophyll at the calibration location in the western basin of the lake. However, the optimized model is unable to reconcile observations of these variables with measured primary productivity during the stratified period. The test-bed calibrated parameters perform well in the 3-D framework at off-shore locations throughout the lake, and result in a 43% improvement in fit to validation data over manually adjusted parameters.

To deal with measurement error, we develop a Bayesian state-space model for stock-recruitment data that contain measurement error in spawner abundance, process error in recruitment, and time series bias. Through extensive simulations across numerous scenarios, we compare the statistical performance of the Bayesian state-space model with that of standard regression for a traditional stock-recruitment model that only considers process error. Performance varies depending on the information content in data, as determined by stock productivity, types of harvest situations, and amount of measurement error. Overall, in terms of estimating optimal spawner abundance S-MSY, the Ricker density-dependence parameter beta, and optimal harvest rate h(MSY), the Bayesian state-space model works best for informative data from low and variable harvest rate situations for high-productivity salmon stocks. The traditional stock-recruitment model (TSR) may be used for estimating alpha and h(MSY) for low-productivity stocks from variable and high harvest rate situations. However, TSR can severely overestimate S-MSY when spawner abundance is measured with large error in low and variable harvest rate situations. We also found that there is substantial merit in using h(MSY) (or benchmarks derived from it) instead of S-MSY as a management target. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.","NO"

MSEU, moreover, is not an esoteric matter of little consequence to the formation of policy for environmental protection and ameliorating the prospective effects of climate change. The paper presents an approach to accounting for MSEU in which the parameters of a model are treated as stochastic processes and modeled as Generalized Random Walks. Our approach is inspired by the algorithms of recursive estimation and filtering theory. In particular, given an innovations representation of the model's structure, we are able to exploit the dichotomy of what is considered to be the (presumed known) in the model's structure and its complement, the (acknowledged unknown). Two conceptually different groups of model parameters attach to this dichotomy: those familiar to us as the conventional parameters in a model's structure; and those having to do with the way in which past (systematic) forecasting errors - in fact, the innovations errors - are distributed (fed back) into the generation of future predictions through a gain matrix (in the sense of filtering theory). A hypothetical biological system with nonlinear dynamics is specified as the prototypical case study for assessing and comparing the performance of our proposed approach with three other approaches to accounting for MSEU: model fitting error; the expansion of parametric uncertainty; and Bayesian model averaging. Our predictive test cases are constructed around future conditions in which the pattern of input disturbances of the system's behavior is broadly similar to that of their past observed pattern (as used for prior identification, or calibration, of the model). In specific terms, however, future input disturbance patterns are significantly different. Our new approach and that of Bayesian model averaging are found to perform well on this hypothetical system; the performances of the approaches of model fitting error and the expansion of parametric uncertainty are shown to be inferior.

This report presents new likelihood-based spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) methods for such data. The methods are shown to be at least as robust in simulations as an equivalent Bayesian analysis, and to have negligible bias and near-nominal confidence interval coverage with parameter values from a lizard data set. It is recommended on the basis of simulation that plots for SECR should be at least as large as the home range of the target species. The R package ""secr"" may be used to fit the models. The likelihood-based implementation extends the spatially explicit analyses available for search data to include binary data (animal detected or not detected on each occasion) or count data (multiple detections per occasion) from multiple irregular polygons, with or without dependence among polygons.

We incorporated several recent developments in occupancy modelling, including the presence of both false negatives and false positives, spatial and temporal correlation and repeated sampling across distinct observers. 3. We investigated optimal allocation of sampling effort (e.g. within and among snowfall events) using simulations. We also compared models that allowed site-level occupancy and track-laying processes to be spatially correlated with models that assumed independence among sites. 4. Both types of models (independence and spatial) performed well across a range of simulated parameter values, but the spatial model resulted in more accurate point estimates for detection parameters and credibility intervals with better coverage rates when data were spatially correlated. When applied to real data, the spatial model resulted in a higher estimate of the occupancy rate ((Psi) over cap) than the baseline model (0.82 vs. 0.59). A minimum of 15-20 helicopter flights, distributed among at least three unique snow events, were needed to meet precision goals (standard error ((Psi) over cap < 0.05). 5. Synthesis and applications.

Estimating temporal trends in animal abundance is central to ecology and conservation, but obtaining useful trend estimates is challenging when animal detection rates vary across surveys (e.g. because of differences in observers or conditions). Methods exist for obtaining abundance estimates using capture-recapture and distance sampling protocols, but only recently have some of these been extended to allow direct estimation of abundance trends when detection rates vary. Extensions to distance sampling for > 2 surveys have not yet been demonstrated. 2. We demonstrate a Bayesian approach for estimating abundance and population trends, using a time series of line-transect data for endangered fin whales Balaenoptera physalus off the west coast of the United States. We use a hierarchical model to partition state and observation processes. Population density is modelled as a function of covariates and random process terms, while observed counts are modelled as an overdispersed Poisson process with rates estimated as a function of population density and detection probability, which is modelled using distance sampling theory. We used Deviance Information Criteria to make multi-model inference about abundance and trend estimates. 3. Bayesian posterior distributions for trend parameters provide strong evidence of increasing fin whale abundance in the California Current study area from 1991 to 2008, while individual abundance estimates during survey years were considerably more precise than previously reported estimates using the same data. Assuming no change in underlying population dynamics, we predict continued increases in fin whale numbers over the next decade. Our abundance projections account for both sampling error in parameter estimates and process variance in annual abundance about the mean trend. 4. Synthesis and applications. Bayesian hierarchical modelling offers numerous benefits for analysing animal abundance trends. In our case, these included its implicit handling of sampling covariance, flexibility to accommodate random effects and covariates, ability to compare trend models of different functional forms and ability to partition sampling and process error to make predictions. Ultimately, by placing distance sampling within a more general hierarchical framework, we obtained more precise abundance estimates and an inference about fin whale trends that would have otherwise been difficult.","NO"

Molecular markers are valuable tools for this type of analysis, and numerous statistical methods have been developed to make the best of the information they can provide. In particular, we recently proposed a Bayesian approach based on a paternity analysis wherein we estimate jointly the variance in male fecundity and the pollen dispersal kernel. 2. Here, we use simulated data sets to investigate the accuracy of the Bayesian approach compared to (i) classical maximumlikelihood approaches (e. g. Neighbourhood model) that ignore variance in male fecundity or explain it through a few covariates and (ii) indirect methods (KinDist and TwoGener) that integrate the variance in fecundity in an 'effective population density'. 3. The Bayesian estimates correctly considered the over-dispersion resulting from the variance in fecundity, resulting in wider but more accurate confidence intervals, in particular in high-density populations. The maximum likelihood methods resulted in confidence intervals with low coverage probabilities and in widespread false-positive tests when testing the effect of covariates on male fecundity. 4. Estimated individual fecundities and estimated empirical variance in fecundity were robust to the distribution assumed for the individual random fecundities (log-normal or Gamma). In contrast, the theoretical variance estimate critically depended on the assumed distribution. 5. The indirect methods provided much more variable estimators, as expected because they use less information about pollen sources and consider the molecular information only through genetic structure indices. 6. Disentangling the fecundity from the spatial effects in paternity analyses is necessary when studying selection in natura and or when addressing the effects of spatial distribution on effective gene flow.

Model parameters may be difficult or impractical to measure, while driver fields are rarely complete, with data gaps due to sensor failure and sparse observational networks. Parameters are generally derived through some optimization method, while driver fields may be interpolated from available data sources. For this study, we used data from a young ponderosa pine stand at Metolius, Central Oregon, and a simple daily model of coupled carbon and water fluxes (DALEC). An ensemble of acceptable parameterizations was generated using an ensemble Kalman filter and eddy covariance measurements of net C exchange. Geostatistical simulations generated an ensemble of meteorological driving variables for the site, consistent with the spatiotemporal autocorrelations inherent in the observational data from 13 local weather stations. Simulated meteorological data were propagated through the model to derive the uncertainty on the CO(2) flux resultant from driver uncertainty typical of spatially extensive modeling studies. Furthermore, the model uncertainty was partitioned between temperature and precipitation. With at least one meteorological station within 25 km of the study site, driver uncertainty was relatively small (similar to 10% of the total net flux), while parameterization uncertainty was larger, similar to 50% of the total net flux. The largest source of driver uncertainty was due to temperature (8% of the total flux). The combined effect of parameter and driver uncertainty was 57% of the total net flux. However, when the nearest meteorological station was >100 km from the study site, uncertainty in net ecosystem exchange (NEE) predictions introduced by meteorological drivers increased by 88%. Precipitation estimates were a larger source of bias in NEE estimates than were temperature estimates, although the biases partly compensated for each other. The time scales on which precipitation errors occurred in the simulations were shorter than the temporal scales over which drought developed in the model, so drought events were reasonably simulated.

We then demonstrate a simple, general correction for regression dilution based on Bayesian methods using latent variables. With this correction in place, unbiased estimates of species occupancy vs. the true environment can be retrieved from data on occupancy vs. measured environment, where measured environment is correlated with the true environment, but subject to substantial measurement error. 3.

For this purpose, the parameters of the neural network, namely, the weights and biases, are represented by fuzzy numbers rather than crisp numbers. Through the application of the extension principle (Zadeh, 1965), the fuzzy number representative of the output variable is then calculated at each time step on the basis of a set of crisp inputs and fuzzy parameters of the neural network. The fuzzy parameters of the neural network are estimated from the modelling process, that is through a calibration procedure that imposes a constraint whereby for an assigned h-level the envelope of the corresponding intervals representing the outputs (forecasted levels or discharges, calculated at different points in time) must include a preset percentage of observed values. The application of the model to two specific cases and a comparison of the results with those provided by other data-driven models - Bayesian neural networks (Neal, 1992) and the Local Uncertainty Estimation Model (Shrestha and Solomatine, 2006) - show its effectiveness in estimating water levels or discharges under uncertainty. The fuzzy neural network enables us to define bands that are expected to contain given percentages of forecasted level/discharge values for each lead time selected: an analysis of the results obtained reveals that these bands (e.g., 99%, 95% and 90% uncertainty bands) generally have a slightly smaller width compared to the bands obtained using other data-driven models.

Here we demonstrate the application of integrated population modelling as a means of deriving robust estimates of the impact of multiple threats for a rapidly declining koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) population in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Integrated population modelling provides a basis for reducing uncertainty and bias by formally integrating information from multiple data sources into a single model. We quantify mortality rates due to threats from dog attacks, vehicle collisions and disease and the extent to which each of these mortality rates would need to be reduced, or how much habitat would need to be restored, to stop the population declining. We show that the integrated population modelling approach substantially reduces uncertainty. We also show that recovery actions that only address single threats would need to reduce those threats to implausibly low levels to recover the population. This indicates that strategies for simultaneously tackling multiple threats are necessary; a situation that is likely to be true for many of the world's threatened species.

Wildlife managers are limited in the inferences they can draw about low density populations. These limits are imposed by biases in monitoring data not regularly accounted for. 2. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to correct biases arising from imperfect detection and spatial autocorrelation. Our analysis incorporated model selection uncertainty by treating model probabilities as parameters to be estimated in the context of model fitting. We fitted our model to count data from a monitoring programme for the mountain plover Charadrius montanus, a low density bird species in Nebraska, USA. 3. Our results demonstrated that previous accounts of the abundance and distribution of plovers in Nebraska were impacted by low detection probabilities (similar to 5-20%). Uncorrected relative abundance estimates showed that the average number of birds per agricultural section increased over time, whereas corrected estimates showed that average abundance was stable. 4. Our method spatially interpolated relative abundance to produce distribution maps. These predictions suggested that birds were selecting some sites more frequently than others based on some habitat feature not explored in our study. Variation in mountain plover abundance appeared more heavily influenced by changes in the number of individuals occupying a few high quality sites, rather than from changes in abundance across many sites. Thus, conservation efforts may not be as efficient when focusing on low to moderate quality sites. 5. Synthesis and applications. Managers who must make decisions based on data-poor systems should adopt rigorous statistical approaches for drawing inferences. Spatial predictions provide information for deciding where to implement management, which is just as important as knowing what kind of management to apply. Our approach provides a step in the direction of making the biological signal in data-poor monitoring programmes more informative for conservation and management.","NO"

Occupancy modeling, which incorporates probabilities of species detection conditional on presence, is an emerging approach for reducing observation bias. However, the current likelihood modeling framework is restrictive for handling unexplained sources of variation in the response that may occur when there are dependence structures such as smaller sampling units that are nested within larger sampling units. We used multilevel Bayesian occupancy modeling to handle dependence structures and to partition sources of variation in occupancy of sites by terrestrial salamanders (family Plethodontidae) within and surrounding an earlier wildfire in western Oregon, USA. Comparison of model fit favored a spatial N-mixture model that accounted for variation in salamander abundance over models that were based on binary detection/non-detection data. Though catch per unit effort was higher in burned areas than unburned, there was strong support that this pattern was due to a higher probability of capture for individuals in burned plots. Within the burn, the odds of capturing an individual given it was present were 2.06 times the odds outside the burn, reflecting reduced complexity of ground cover in the burn. There was weak support that true occupancy was lower within the burned area. While the odds of occupancy in the burn were 0.49 times the odds outside the burn among the five species, the magnitude of variation attributed to the burn was small in comparison to variation attributed to other landscape variables and to unexplained, spatially autocorrelated random variation. While ordinary occupancy models may separate the biological pattern of interest from variation in detection probability when all sources of variation are known, the addition of random effects structures for unexplained sources of variation in occupancy and detection probability may often more appropriately represent levels of uncertainty.","MAYBE"

Predicting the current and potential distributions of established invasive species is critical for evaluating management options, but methods for differentiating these distributions have received little attention. In particular, there is uncertainty among invasive species managers about the value of information from incidental sightings compared to data from designed field surveys. This study compares the two approaches, and develops a unifying framework, using the case of invasive sambar deer Cervus unicolor in Victoria, Australia. 2. We first used 391 incidental sightings of sambar deer and 12 biophysical variables to construct a presence-only habitat suitability model using Maxent. We then used that model to stratify field sampling, with proportionately greater sampling of cells with high predicted habitat suitability. Field sampling, consisting of faecal pellet surveys, sign surveys and camera trapping, was conducted in 80 4-km2 grid cells. A Bayesian state-space occupancy model was used to predict probability of suitable habitat from the field data. 3. The Maxent and occupancy models predicted similar spatial distributions of habitat suitability for sambar deer in Victoria and there was a strong positive correlation between the rankings of cells by the two approaches. The congruence of the two models suggests that any spatial and detection biases in the presence-only data were relatively unimportant in our study. 4. We predicted the extent of suitable habitat from the occupancy model using a threshold that gave a false negative error rate of 0 center dot 05. The current distribution was the suitable habitat within a kernel that had a 99 center dot 5% chance of including the presence locations pooled from incidental sightings and field surveys: the potential distribution was suitable habitat outside that kernel. Several discrete areas of potential distribution were identified as priorities for surveillance monitoring with the aim of detecting and managing incursions of sambar deer. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our framework enables managers to robustly estimate the current and potential distributions of established invasive species using either presence-only and/or presence-absence data. Managers can then focus control and/or containment actions within the current distribution and establish surveillance monitoring to detect incursions within the potential distribution.","NO"

To support efficient decision making and to better target investment in management actions, such modelling tools need to link socioeconomic information with biophysical data. However, there is still limited experience in developing catchment models that consider environmental changes and economic values in a single framework. We describe a model development process where biophysical modelling is integrated with economic information on the non-market environmental costs and benefits of catchment management changes for a study of the George catchment in northeast Tasmania, Australia. An integrated assessment approach and Bayesian network modelling techniques were used to integrate knowledge about hydrological, ecological and economic systems. Rather than coupling existing information and models, synchronous data collection and model development ensured tailored information exchange between the different components. The approach is largely transferable to the development of integrated hydro-economic models in other river catchments. Our experiences highlight the challenges in synchronizing economic and scientific modelling. These include the selection of common attributes and definition of their levels suitable for the catchment modelling and economic valuation. The lessons from the model development process are useful for future studies that aim to integrate scientific and economic knowledge. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","NO"

Understanding landholder decision-making is now acknowledged as fundamental to achieving better policy outcomes. There is a large body of research examining landholder adoption of conservation practices. Social researchers are able to employ a suite of conventional techniques to analyse their survey data and assist in identifying significant and causal relationships between variables. However, these techniques can be limited by the type of data available, the breadth of issues that can be represented and the extent that causality can be explored. In this paper we discuss the findings of a unique study exploring the benefits of combining Bayesian Networks (BNs) with conventional statistical analysis to examine landholder adoption. Our research examined the landholder fencing of native bushland in the Wimmera region in south east Australia. Findings from this study suggest that BNs provided enhanced understanding of the presence and strength of causal relationships. There was also the additional benefit that a BN could be quickly developed and that this process helped the research team clarify and understand relationships between variables. However, a key finding was that the interpretation of the results of the BNs was complemented by the conventional data analysis and expert review. An additional benefit of the BNs is their capacity to present key findings in a format that is more easily interpreted by researchers and enables researchers to more easily communicate their findings to natural resource practitioners and policy makers.

The management goal is firstly to set achievable targets for water quality entering the Great Barrier Reef lagoon from the Mackay Whitsunday natural resource management region and then secondly to define and implement a strategy to achieve these targets. The BBN serves as an adaptive framework that managers and scientists may use to articulate what they know about the managed system.

We demonstrate the combined modelling approach with a case study investigating increases in woody vegetation density in northern Australia's tropical savannas. We found that by utilising the strengths of a simulation model and a Bayesian network we could both forecast future change in woody vegetation density and diagnose the reasons for current vegetation states. The local conditions of climate, soil characteristics and the starting population of trees were found to be more important in explaining the likelihood of change in woody vegetation density compared to management practices such as grazing pressure and fire regimes. We conclude that combining the strengths of a process and BN model allowed us to produce a simple model that utilised the ability of the process model to simulate ecosystem processes in detail and over long time periods, and the ability of the BN to capture uncertainty in ecosystem response and to conduct scenario, sensitivity and diagnostic analysis.

Host-specificity is important in fundamental and applied studies of biodiversity, but it is difficult to generate definitive data for many species. 2. Here, we present a model framework for estimating the realized host breadth of dependent fauna from samples collected from replicate host individuals. We use Bayesian, Zero-inflated Poisson regression to model the abundance conditional upon host use - our focal parameter. We illustrate the model using a data set of insects on threatened and non-threatened plant species from eastern Australia. Estimating co-extinction risk through threats to host organisms is a key application for the model, requiring assessment of the host-specificity of biota, whilst incorporating uncertainty. 3. The host breadth model indicated that several insect species had high probability of narrow host breadth, including several species that appeared to only have one host.

In the fisheries community, the electronic tagging of vessels commonly designated by Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) is developing and provides a new insight for the understanding, the analysis and the modelling of the trajectories of vessels and their prospecting behaviour. VMS data are thus a clue for the proper definition of fishing effort which remains a fundamental parameter of tuna stock assessments. In this context, we used the VMS (recording of hourly positions) of the French tropical tuna purse-seiners operating in the Indian Ocean to characterise three types of movement (states) on the VMS trajectories (stillness, tracking, and cruising). Based on empirical evidences, and on the regular frequency of VMS acquisition, this was achieved by the development of a Bayesian Hidden Markov model for the speeds and turning angles derived from the hourly steps of the trajectories. In a second phase, states were related to activities disentangling stillness into fishing or stop at sea. Finally the quality of the model performances was rigorously quantified thanks to observers' data. Confronting model prediction and true activities allowed estimating that 10% of the hourly steps were misclassified. The assumptions and model' choices are discussed, highlighting the fact that VMS data and observers' data having different time resolutions, the effective use of validating data was troublesome. However, without validation, these analyses remain speculative.

In many adaptive-management problems that have been studied, the optimal active and passive policies (accounting for learning when designing policies and designing policy on the basis of current best information, respectively) are very similar. This seems paradoxical; when faced with uncertainty about the best course of action, managers should spend very little effort on actively designing programs to learn about the system they are managing. We considered two possible reasons why active and passive adaptive solutions are often similar. First, the benefits of learning are often confined to the particular case study in the modeled scenario, whereas in reality information gained from local studies is often applied more broadly. Second, management objectives that incorporate the variance of an estimate may place greater emphasis on learning than more commonly used objectives that aim to maximize an expected value. We explored these issues in a case study of Merri Creek, Melbourne, Australia, in which the aim was to choose between two options for revegetation. We explicitly incorporated monitoring costs in the model. The value of the terminal rewards and the choice of objective both influenced the difference between active and passive adaptive solutions. Explicitly considering the cost of monitoring provided a different perspective on how the terminal reward and management objective affected learning. The states for which it was optimal to monitor did not always coincide with the states in which active and passive adaptive management differed. Our results emphasize that spending resources on monitoring is only optimal when the expected benefits of the options being considered are similar and when the pay-off for learning about their benefits is large.","MAYBE"

Although this bias can be formally expressed, it requires knowledge about natural survival without any competing mortality source, which is difficult to assess in most cases. Another difficulty lies in estimating the true process correlation while properly accounting for sampling variation. Using a Bayesian approach, we developed a state-space model to assess the correlation between two competing sources of mortality. By distinguishing the mortality process from its observation through dead recoveries and live recaptures, we estimated the process correlation. To correct for the intrinsic bias, we incorporated experts' opinions on natural survival. We illustrated our approach using data on a hunted population of wild boars. Mortalities were not additive and natural mortality increased with hunting mortality likely as a consequence of non-controlled mortality by crippling loss.

Conservationists routinely use species distribution models to plan conservation, restoration and development actions, while ecologists use them to infer process from pattern. These models tend to work well for common or easily observable species, but are of limited utility for rare and cryptic species. This may be because honest accounting of known observation bias and spatial autocorrelation are rarely included, thereby limiting statistical inference of resulting distribution maps. 2. We specified and implemented a spatially explicit Bayesian hierarchical model for a cryptic mammal species (pygmy rabbit Brachylagus idahoensis). Our approach used two levels of indirect sign that are naturally hierarchical (burrows and faecal pellets) to build a model that allows for inference on regression coefficients as well as spatially explicit model parameters. We also produced maps of rabbit distribution (occupied burrows) and relative abundance (number of burrows expected to be occupied by pygmy rabbits). The model demonstrated statistically rigorous spatial prediction by including spatial autocorrelation and measurement uncertainty. 3. We demonstrated flexibility of our modelling framework by depicting probabilistic distribution predictions using different assumptions of pygmy rabbit habitat requirements. 4. Spatial representations of the variance of posterior predictive distributions were obtained to evaluate heterogeneity in model fit across the spatial domain.

High levels of riverine nutrient input during the 1970s and 1980s caused eutrophic conditions including intense algal blooms resulting in hypoxia and the subsequent collapse of benthic habitats on the northwestern shelf. intense fishing pressure also depleted stocks of many apex predators, contributing to an increase in planktivorous fish that are now the focus of fishing efforts. Additionally, the Black Sea's ecosystem changed even further with the introduction of exotic species. Economic collapse of the surrounding socialist republics in the early 1990s resulted in decreased nutrient loading which has allowed the Black Sea ecosystem to start to recover, but under rapidly changing economic and political conditions, future recovery is uncertain. In this study we use a multidisciplinary approach to integrate information from socioeconomic and ecological systems to model the effects of future development scenarios on the marine environment of the northwestern Black Sea shelf. The Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework was used to construct conceptual models, explicitly mapping impacts of socio-economic Drivers on the marine ecosystem. Bayesian belief networks (BBNs), a stochastic modelling technique, were used to quantify these causal relationships, operationalise models and assess the effects of alternative development paths on the Black Sea ecosystem. BBNs use probabilistic dependencies as a common metric, allowing the integration of quantitative and qualitative information. Under the Baseline Scenario, recovery of the Black Sea appears tenuous as the exploitation of environmental resources (agriculture, fishing and shipping) increases with continued economic development of post-Soviet countries. This results in the loss of wetlands through drainage and reclamation. Water transparency decreases as phytoplankton bloom and this deterioration in water quality leads to the degradation of coastal plant communities (Cystoseira, seagrass) and also Phyllophora habitat on the shelf. Decomposition of benthic plants results in hypoxia killing flora and fauna associated with these habitats. Ecological pressure from these factors along with constant levels of fishing activity results in target stocks remaining depleted. Of the four Alternative Scenarios, two show improvements on the Baseline ecosystem condition, with improved waste water treatment and reduced fishing pressure, while the other two show a worsening, due to increased natural resource exploitation leading to rapid reversal of any recent ecosystem recovery. From this we conclude that variations in economic policy have significant consequences for the health of the Black Sea, and ecosystem recovery is directly linked to social-economic choices.

However, the treatment of error in many of these efforts is arguably selective and/or ad hoc. A Bayesian hierarchical framework enables the development of robust probabilistic analysis of error and uncertainty in model predictions by explicitly accommodating measurement error, parameter uncertainty, and model structure imperfection. This paper presents a Bayesian hierarchical formulation for simultaneously calibrating aquatic biogeochemical models at multiple systems (or sites of the same system) with differences in their trophic conditions, prior precisions of model parameters, available information, measurement error or inter-annual variability. Our statistical formulation also explicitly considers the uncertainty in model inputs (model parameters, initial conditions), the analytical/sampling error associated with the field data, and the discrepancy between model structure and the natural system dynamics (e.g., missing key ecological processes, erroneous formulations, misspecified forcing functions). The comparison between observations and posterior predictive monthly distributions indicates that the plankton models calibrated under the Bayesian hierarchical scheme provided accurate system representations for all the scenarios examined. Our results also suggest that the Bayesian hierarchical approach allows overcoming problems of insufficient local data by ""borrowing strength"" from well-studied sites and this feature will be highly relevant to conservation practices of regions with a high number of freshwater resources for which complete data could never be practically collected. Finally, we discuss the prospect of extending this framework to spatially explicit biogeochemical models (e.g., more effectively connect inshore with offshore areas) along with the benefits for environmental management, such as the optimization of the sampling design of monitoring programs and the alignment with the policy practice of adaptive management.

The message for model fitting of real data is to consider the likelihood surface in detail, check whether the best fit model is located on a likelihood ridge and, if so, evaluate predictive differences of biologically plausible models along the ridge. We present a detailed analysis of a focal data set showing how multimodality and ridges emerge in practice for fits of several parametric models, including a state-space model with explicit accommodation of observation error.

Understanding the spatial distributions of these new diseases is important for disease management and policy makers; however, the data are complicated by heterogeneities across host classes, sampling variance, sampling biases, and the space-time epidemic process. Ignoring these issues can lead to false conclusions or obscure important patterns in the data, such as spatial variation in disease prevalence. Here, we applied hierarchical Bayesian disease mapping methods to account for risk factors and to estimate spatial and temporal patterns of infection by chronic wasting disease (CWD) in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) of Wisconsin, USA. We found significant heterogeneities for infection due to age, sex, and spatial location. Infection probability increased with age for all young deer, increased with age faster for young males, and then declined for some older animals, as expected from disease-associated mortality and age-related changes in infection risk. We found that disease prevalence was clustered in a central location, as expected under a simple spatial epidemic process where disease prevalence should increase with time and expand spatially. However, we could not detect any consistent temporal or spatiotemporal trends in CWD prevalence. Estimates of the temporal trend indicated that prevalence may have decreased or increased with nearly equal posterior probability, and the model without temporal or spatiotemporal effects was nearly equivalent to models with these effects based on deviance information criteria. For maximum interpretability of the role of location as a disease risk factor, we used the technique of direct standardization for prevalence mapping, which we develop and describe. These mapping results allow disease management actions to be employed with reference to the estimated spatial distribution of the disease and to those host classes most at risk.

The role of dispersal becomes pronounced in highly fragmented landscapes inhabited by spatially structured populations. We consider a landscape consisting of a set of habitat patches surrounded by unsuitable matrix, and model dispersal by assuming that the individuals follow a random walk with parameters that may be specific to the habitat type. We allow for spatial variation in patch quality, and account for edge-mediated behavior, the latter meaning that the individuals bias their movement towards the patches when close to an edge between a patch and the matrix. We employ a diffusion approximation of the random walk model to derive analytical expressions for various characteristics of the dispersal process. For example, we derive formulae for the time that an individual is expected to spend in its current patch i, and for the time that it will spend in the matrix, both conditional on the individual hitting next a given patch j before hitting any of the other patches or dying. The analytical formulae are based on the assumptions that the landscape is infinitely large, that the patches are circularly shaped, and that the patches are small compared to interpatch distances. We evaluate the effect of these assumptions by comparing the analytical results to numerical results in a real patch network that violates all of the three assumptions. We then consider a landscape that fulfills the assumptions, and show that in this case the analytical results are in a very good agreement with the numerical results.

Catch-effort modeling of the hunting effort required to dispatch pigs during the eradication program was used to determine the relationship between detection probability and searching effort for different hunting methods. We then used these relationships to estimate the amount of monitoring effort required to declare eradication successful with criteria that either set a threshold for the probability that pigs remained undetected (type I error) or minimized the net expected costs of the eradication program (cost of type I and II errors). For aerial and ground-based monitoring techniques, the amount of search effort required to declare eradication successful on the basis of either criterion was highly dependent on the prior belief in the success of the program unless monitoring intensities exceeded 30 km of searching effort per square kilometer of search area for aerial monitoring and, equivalently, 38 km for ground monitoring. Calculation of these criteria to gauge the success of eradication should form an essential component of any eradication program as it allows for a transparent assessment of the risks inherent in the decision to terminate the program.","YES"

Only then can we be con. dent in the scientific inferences and forecasts made from an analysis. Probability and statistics provide a framework that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Given the complexities of ecological studies, the hierarchical statistical model is an invaluable tool. This approach is not new in ecology, and there are many examples ( both Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature illustrating the benefits of this approach. In this article, we provide a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods, from which discussion on hierarchical statistical modeling in ecology can proceed. We have also planted some seeds for discussion and tried to show where the practical difficulties lie. Our thesis is that hierarchical statistical modeling is a powerful way of approaching ecological analysis in the presence of inevitable but quanti. able uncertainties, even if practical issues sometimes require pragmatic compromises.","YES"

In particular, when observed data are limited in sample size or representativeness, then the Bayesian framework provides a mechanism to combine observed data with other ""prior'' information. Prior information may be obtained from earlier studies, or in their absence, from expert knowledge. This use of the Bayesian framework reflects the scientific ""learning cycle,'' where prior or initial estimates are updated when new data become available. In this paper we outline a framework for statistical design of expert elicitation processes for quantifying such expert knowledge, in a form suitable for input as prior information into Bayesian models. We identify six key elements: determining the purpose and motivation for using prior information; specifying the relevant expert knowledge available; formulating the statistical model; designing effective and efficient numerical encoding; managing uncertainty; and designing a practical elicitation protocol. We demonstrate this framework applies to a variety of situations, with two examples from the ecological literature and three from our experience. Analysis of these examples reveals several recurring important issues affecting practical design of elicitation in ecological problems.","YES"

These judgements are difficult to test, consequently it is easy for models to become over-parameterised, potentially increasing uncertainty in predictions. The work we describe is a step towards addressing these difficulties. We propose and implement a method which explores a family of simpler models obtained by replacing model variables with constants (model reduction by variable replacement). The procedure iteratively searches the simpler model formulations and compares models in terms of their ability to predict observed data, evaluated within a Bayesian framework. The results can be summarised as posterior model probabilities and replacement probabilities for individual variables which lend themselves to mechanistic interpretation. This provides powerful diagnostic information to support model development, and can identify areas of model over-parameterisation with implications for interpretation of model results. We present the application of the method to 3 example models. In each case reduced models are identified which outperform the original full model in terms of comparisons to observations, suggesting some over-parameterisation has occurred during model development. We argue that the proposed approach is relevant to anyone involved in the development or use of process based mathematical models, especially those where understanding is encoded via empirically based relationships.

Additional research is needed to acquire further knowledge and understanding of different types of uncertainty (e.g., knowledge, variability, decision, and linguistic uncertainty) inherent in environmental decision-making, and how these areas of uncertainty affect the quality of decisions rendered. Modeling and decision support tools (e.g., integrated assessment models, optimization algorithms, and multicriteria decision analysis tools) are being used increasingly for comparative analysis and uncertainty assessment of environmental management alternatives. If such tools are to provide effective decision support, the uncertainties associated with all aspects of the decision-making process need to be explicitly considered. However, as models become more complex to better represent integrated environmental, social and economic systems, achieving this goal becomes more difficult. Some of the important issues that need to be addressed in relation to the incorporation of uncertainty in environmental decision-making processes include: (1) the development of methods for quantifying the uncertainty associated with human input; (2) the development of appropriate risk-based performance criteria that are understood and accepted by a range of disciplines; (3) improvement of fuzzy environmental decision-making through the development of hybrid approaches (e.g., fuzzy-rule-based models combined with probabilistic data-driven techniques); (4) development of methods for explicitly conveying uncertainties in environmental decision-making through the use of Bayesian probability theory; (5) incorporating adaptive management practices into the environmental decision-making process, including model divergence correction; (6) the development of approaches and strategies for increasing the computational efficiency of integrated models, optimization methods, and methods for estimating risk-based performance measures; and (7) the development of integrated frameworks for comprehensively addressing uncertainty as part of the environmental decision-making process.

For many odontocete (dolphin, porpoise, toothed whale) populations, only fertility and age-at-death data are feasibly obtainable. We describe a Bayesian approach for using fertilities and two types of age-at-death data (i.e., age structure of deaths from all mortality sources and age structure of anthropogenic mortalities only) to estimate rate of increase, mortality rates, and impacts of anthropogenic mortality on those rates for a population assumed to be in a stable age structure. We used strandings data from 1977 to 1993 (n = 96) and observer bycatch data from 1989 to 1993 (n 233) for the Gulf of Maine, USA, and Bay of Fundy, Canada, harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) population as a case study. Our method combines mortality risk functions to estimate parameters describing age-specific natural and bycatch mortality rates. Separate functions are simultaneously fit to bycatch and strandings data, the latter of which are described as a mixture of natural and bycatch mortalities. Euler-Lotka equations and an estimate of longevity were used to constrain parameter estimates, and we included a parameter to account for unequal probabilities of natural vs. bycatch deaths occurring in a sample. We fit models under two scenarios intended to correct for possible data bias due to indirect bycatch of calves (i. e., death following bycatch mortality of mothers) being underrepresented in the bycatch sample. Results from the two scenarios were ""model averaged'' by sampling from both Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains with uniform probability. The median estimate for potential population growth (r(nat)) was 0.046 (90% credible interval [CRI] = 0.004 -0.116). The median for actual growth (r) was -0.030 (90% CRI =-0.192 to + 0.065). The probability of population decline due to added fisheries mortality, prior to management to reduce bycatch, was 0.690. Our approach takes into account multiple sources of uncertainty in data and process, and it provides posterior distributions for a rich set of demographic rate parameters that are unknown for most cetaceans.

Estimation of overall abundance can be difficult and is inefficient via intensive approaches such as capture-mark-recapture (CMR) or distance sampling. We propose a two-phase sampling scheme and model in a Bayesian framework to estimate abundance for patchily distributed populations. In the first phase, occupancy is estimated by binomial detection samples taken on all selected sites, where selection may be of all sites available, or a random sample of sites. Detection can be by visual surveys, detection of sign, physical captures, or other approach. At the second phase, if a detection threshold is achieved, CMR or other intensive sampling is conducted via standard procedures (grids or webs) to estimate abundance. Detection and CMR data are then used in a joint likelihood to model probability of detection in the occupancy sample via an abundance detection model. CMR modeling is used to estimate abundance for the abundance-detection relationship, which in turn is used to predict abundance at the remaining sites, where only detection data are collected. We present a full Bayesian modeling treatment of this problem, in which posterior inference on abundance and other parameters (detection, capture probability) is obtained under a variety of assumptions about spatial and individual sources of heterogeneity. We apply the approach to abundance estimation for two species of voles (Microtus spp.) in Montana, USA. We also use a simulation study to evaluate the frequentist properties of our procedure given known patterns in abundance and detection among sites as well as design criteria. For most population characteristics and designs considered, bias and mean-square error (MSE) were low, and coverage of true parameter values by Bayesian credibility intervals was near nominal. Our two-phase, adaptive approach allows efficient estimation of abundance of rare and patchily distributed species and is particularly appropriate when sampling in all patches is impossible, but a global estimate of abundance is required.","NO"

In the yield gap analysis approach, linear regression and stepwise selection are used to identify and rank the limiting factors of crop yield. The main value of stepwise selection is that it can be used to select a subset of explanatory variables by using statistical criteria. The number of parameters in the final model obtained by using such a procedure is expected to be less than in the complete model, and the variance of the estimated parameters can be reduced. Nonetheless, several recent studies have emphasized the limitations of stepwise selection, such as the lack of stability of the set of selected variables and bias in the parameter estimates. Model mixing methods like Bayesian model averaging (BMA) have been proposed as an alternative, but these methods have never been used for yield gap analysis. The objective of this paper was to compare stepwise selection methods and BMA for yield gap analysis. Our comparison was based on 10 000 bootstrap samples drawn from a dataset of 160 plots including 8 years of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) experiments. Parameter estimates obtained after stepwise selection were compared to the estimated values obtained without any selection and to the estimated values obtained with BMA. The results showed that these statistical methods led to contrasted frequencies of variables selections and to different estimated parameter values. The frequencies of selection were greater with BMA than with stepwise selection. BMA also gave smaller standard deviations for parameter estimates in many cases, but this was not always the case. Compared to the stepwise selection methods, the parameter estimates obtained with BMA were closer to zero. Our results showed that the bootstrap approach can efficiently allow agronomists to compare various statistical methods for selecting explanatory variables and for estimating the effects of limiting factors.

Nevertheless, statistical techniques commonly used for developing such models may give misleading results because they fail to account for 3 factors common in data sets of species distribution: spatial autocorrelation, the large number of sites where the species is absent (zero inflation), and uneven survey effort. We used spatial autoregressive models fit with Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to assess the relationship between older coniferous forest and the abundance of Northern Spotted Owl nest and activity sites throughout the species' range. The spatial random-effect term incorporated in the autoregressive models successfully accounted for zero inflation and reduced the effect of survey bias on estimates of species-habitat associations. Our results support the hypothesis that the relationship between owl distribution and older forest varies with latitude. A quadratic relationship between owl abundance and older forest was evident in the southern portion of the range, and a pseudothreshold relationship was evident in the northern portion of the range. Our results suggest that proposed changes to the network of owl habitat reserves would reduce the proportion of the population protected by up to one-third, and that proposed guidelines for forest management within reserves underestimate the proportion of older forest associated with maximum owl abundance and inappropriately generalize threshold relationships among subregions. Bayesian spatial models can greatly enhance the utility of habitat analysis for conservation planning because they add the statistical flexibility necessary for analyzing regional survey data while retaining the interpretability of simpler models.","NO"

Seed dispersal is a critical life stage of plants, yet accurate measurement of dispersal distances has been difficult in natural systems. Genetic techniques for matching dispersed seeds to maternal trees provide valuable data on dispersal events. Questions remain regarding how best to estimate the population seed dispersal distance distributions from such data and how these estimates compare with classical non-genetic estimates based on seed trap data alone. 2. Using simulated data, we compared seed shadow estimates obtained via standard inverse modelling of seed arrival into seed traps within mapped stands (summed seed shadow, SSS) with estimates from four models using genetic matches: direct fitting of the observed distribution of distances in the genotyped sample (observed distance, OBS), direct fitting inversely weighted by sampling intensity (OBSw), inverse modelling of numbers of seeds of each genotype in each trap (gene shadow model, GSM), and inverse modelling of frequencies of each genotype in each trap (competing sources model, CSM). We further explored how consideration of immigrant seed rain from unmapped and ungenotyped trees outside the stand affected dispersal estimates, denoting these variants SSSi, GSMi and CSMi. 3. We applied these models to an empirical data set for the Neotropical tree Jacaranda copaia, using a hierarchical Bayesian model to incorporate variation in fecundity among trees. 4. Fits to simulated data sets showed that OBS and SSS estimates were strongly biased, while SSSi, GSMi and CSMi were mildly biased. Root mean square errors varied as OBS >> SSS > OBSw > CSMi > GSMi > SSi > CSM > GSM. 5. Comparing results for Jacaranda under the three best models, mean posterior estimates of dispersal distances varied as SSSi < GSM < CSM, but credible intervals overlapped among all three models, demonstrating agreement that long-distance dispersal is common. 6. Synthesis. Here we reconcile two general approaches used to study seed dispersal distances in natural communities. Genetic and non-genetic approaches can both provide good estimates of seed dispersal provided that analyses of genetic data take account of any deviation from random selection of seeds for genotyping, and that SSS models consider immigrant seed rain in the analysis whenever there is reason to think its contribution is non-zero. The use of the models presented here should provide better estimates of population-level dispersal distance distributions in genetic and classical seed dispersal studies.","NO"

Many of these practitioners are also using Bayesian belief networks based on expert opinion to fill gaps in empirical information. The practical application of this approach can be limited by the need to populate large conditional probability tables and the complexity associated with ecological feedback cycles. In this paper, we describe a modeling approach that helps solve these problems by embedding a qualitative analysis of sign directed graphs into the probabilistic framework of a Bayesian belief network. Our approach incorporates the effects of feedback on the model's response to a sustained change in one or more of its parameters, provides an efficient means to explore the effect of alternative model structures, mitigates the cognitive bias in expert opinion, and is amenable to stakeholder input. We demonstrate our approach by examining two published case studies: a host-parasitoid community centered on a nonnative, agricultural pest of citrus cultivars and the response of an experimental lake mesocosm to nutrient input.

Because of the implied assumptions of each tool, model selection criteria should be chosen a priori for the problem at hand, - a model that is considered 'good' in its explanatory power may not be the best choice for a problem that requires prediction. In this paper, I review the behavior and assumptions of the four most commonly used statistical criteria (Akaike's Information Criterion, AIC; Schwarz or Bayesian Information Criterion, BIC; Deviance Information Criterion, DIC; Bayes factors). Second, I illustrate differences in these model selection tools by applying the four criteria to thousands of simulated abundance trajectories. With the simulation model known, I examine whether each of the criteria are useful in selecting models to evaluate simple questions, such as whether time series support evidence of density dependent population growth. Across simulations, the maximum likelihood criteria consistently favored simpler population models when compared to Bayesian criteria. Among the Bayesian criteria, the Bayes factor favored the correct simulation model more frequently than the Deviance information Criterion. There was considerable uncertainty in the ability of the Bayes factor to discriminate between models, this tool selected the simulation model slightly more frequently than other approaches.

For soil chemistry research, scaling from the plot to the region is especially difficult due to high spatial variability at all scales.

The Bayesian approach was compared to a traditional approach that multiplied mean values for urban mesic residential, urban xeric residential, nonresidential urban, agricultural, and desert areas by the aerial coverage of each land-use type. Both approaches suggest that oC, N, and avP are correlated with each other and are higher (in g/m(2)) in mesic residential and agricultural areas than in deserts or xeric residential areas. In addition to traditional biophysical variables, cultural variables related to impervious surface cover, tree cover, and turfgrass cover were significant in regression models predicting the regional distribution of soil properties. We estimate that 1140 Gg of oC have accumulated in human-dominated soils of this region, but a significant portion of this new C has a very short mean residence time in mesic yards and agricultural soils. For N, we estimate that 130 Gg have accumulated in soils, which explains a significant portion of ""missing N"" observed in the regional N budget. Predictions for iC differed between the approaches because the Bayesian approach predicted iC as a function of elevation while the traditional approach employed only land use. We suggest that Bayesian scaling enables models that are flexible enough to accommodate the diverse factors controlling soil chemistry in desert, urban, and agricultural ecosystems and, thus, may represent an important tool for ecological scaling that spans land-use types. Urban planners and city managers attempting to reduce C emissions and N pollution should consider ways that landscape choices and impervious surface cover affect city-wide soil C, N, and P storage.","NO"

The incorporation of mechanism improves the confidence in predictions made for a variety of conditions, while the statistical methods provide an empirical basis for parameter estimation and allow for estimates of predictive uncertainty. Our illustration focuses on eutrophication modeling but the proposed methodological framework can be easily transferred to a wide variety of disciplines (e.g., hydrology, ecotoxicology, air pollution).

There has been no way to formally integrate different types of data and problems of estimation that result from (1) multiple sources of observation error, which frequently result in impossible estimates of negative growth, (2) the fact that data are typically sparse (a few trees or a few years), whereas inference is needed broadly (many trees over many years), (3) the fact that some unknown fraction of the variance is shared across the population, and (4) the fact that growth rates of trees within competing stands are not independent. We develop a hierarchical Bayes state space model for tree growth that addresses all of these challenges, allowing for formal inference that is consistent with the available data and the assumption that growth is nonnegative. Prediction follows directly, incorporating the full uncertainty from inference with scenarios for ""filling the gaps"" for past growth rates and for future conditions affecting growth.

Efforts are related to a regularisation method which is based on a Bayesian Information Criterion-like and to the determination of a confidence interval of forecasting. We offer a statistical validation between various statistical models and a deterministic chemistry-transport model. In this experiment, with the final neural network, the ozone peaks are fairly well predicted (in terms of global fit), with an Agreement Index= 92%, the Mean Absolute Error= the Root Mean Square Error = 15 mu g m(-3) and the Mean Bias Error = 5 mu g m(-3), where the European threshold of the hourly ozone is 180 mu g m(-3). To improve the performance of this exceedance forecasting, instead of the previous model, we use a neural classifier with a sigmoid function in the output layer. The output of the network ranges from [0,1] and can be interpreted as the probability of exceedance of the threshold. This model is compared to a classical logistic regression. With this neural classifier, the Success Index of forecasting is 78% whereas it is from 65% to 72% with the classical MLPs.

It has been increasingly appreciated that these parameters must be estimated separately from detection probability to avoid the biases induced by nondetection error. Hence, there is now considerable theoretical and practical interest in dynamic occupancy models that contain explicit representations of metapopulation dynamics such as extinction, colonization, and turnover as well as growth rates. We describe a hierarchical parameterization of these models that is analogous to the state-space formulation of models in time series, where the model is represented by two components, one for the partially observable occupancy process and another for the observations conditional on that process. This parameterization naturally allows estimation of all parameters of the conventional approach to occupancy models, but in addition, yields great flexibility and extensibility, e.g., to modeling heterogeneity or latent structure in model parameters. We also highlight the important distinction between population and finite sample inference; the latter yields much more precise estimates for the particular sample at hand. Finite sample estimates can easily be obtained using the state-space representation of the model but are difficult to obtain under the conventional approach of likelihood-based estimation. We use R and Win BUGS to apply the model to two examples. In a standard analysis for the European Crossbill in a large Swiss monitoring program, we fit a model with year-specific parameters. Estimates of the dynamic parameters varied greatly among years, highlighting the irruptive population dynamics of that species. In the second example, we analyze route occupancy of Cerulean Warblers in the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) using a model allowing for site-specific heterogeneity in model parameters. The results indicate relatively low turnover and a stable distribution of Cerulean Warblers which is in contrast to analyses of counts of individuals from the same survey that indicate important declines. This discrepancy illustrates the inertia in occupancy relative to actual abundance. Furthermore, the model reveals a declining patch survival probability, and increasing turnover, toward the edge of the range of the species, which is consistent with metapopulation perspectives on the genesis of range edges. Given detection/non-detection data, dynamic occupancy models as described here have considerable potential for the study of distributions and range dynamics.","YES"

State-space models can account for process error and measurement error simultaneously to correct for the bias in the estimates of system state and model parameters. However, few studies have compared the performance of different nonlinear state-space models for reconstructing the state of population dynamics from noisy time series. This study compared the performance of the extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and Bayesian nonlinear state-space models (BNSSM) through simulations. Synthetic population time series were generated using the theta logistic model with known parameters, and normally distributed process and measurement errors were introduced using the Monte Carlo simulations. At higher levels of nonlinearity, the UKF and BNSSM had lower root mean square error (RMSE) than the EKF. The BNSSM performed reliably across all levels of nonlinearity, whereas increased levels of nonlinearity resulted in higher RMSE of the EKF. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm within the Gibbs algorithm was used to fit the theta logistic model to synthetic time series to estimate model parameters. The estimated posterior distribution of the parameter 0 indicated that the 95% credible intervals included the true values of theta (=0.5 and 1.5), but did not include 1.0 and 0.0.

Both forms of autocorrelation can violate the assumptions of generalized linear regression models, resulting in biased estimation of model coefficients and diminished predictive performance. Such consequences may be avoided for extrinsic autocorrelation when autocorrelated environmental variables are available for use as model covariates, whereas intrinsic spatial autocorrelation requires an alternative modeling approach. The autologistic model provides an approach suited to the binary observations often obtained in wildlife surveys, but its performance has not been tested across widely varying sampling intensities or strengths of intrinsic spatial structure. Here we use simulated data to test the autologistic model under a range of sampling conditions. The autologistic model obtains better fits and substantially better predictive performance than the standard logistic regression model over the full range of sampling designs and intensities tested.

However, because climate observations are unevenly spaced and have incomplete records, such fields need to be estimated. In addition, uncertainty in these fields associated with their estimation are rarely assessed. Ecological models are usually driven with a geostatistical model's mean estimate (kriging) of these fields without accounting for this uncertainty, much less evaluating such errors in terms of their propagation in ecological simulations. We introduce a Bayesian statistical framework to model climate observations to create spatially uniform and temporally complete fields, taking into account correlation in time and space, spatial heterogeneity, lack of normality, and uncertainty about all these factors. A key benefit of the Bayesian model is that it generates uncertainty measures for the generated fields. To demonstrate this method, we reconstruct historical monthly precipitation fields (a driver for ecological models) on a fine resolution grid for a climatically heterogeneous region in the western United States. The main goal of this work is to evaluate the sensitivity of ecological models to the uncertainty associated with prediction of their climate drivers. To assess their numerical sensitivity to predicted input variables, we generate a set of ecological model simulations run using an ensernble of different versions of the reconstructed fields. We construct such an ensemble by sampling from the posterior predictive distribution of the climate field. We demonstrate that the estimated prediction error of the climate field can be very high. We evaluate the importance of such errors in ecological model experiments using an ensemble of historical precipitation time series in simulations of grassland biogeochemical dynamics with an ecological numerical model, Century. We show how uncertainty in predicted precipitation fields is propagated into ecological model results and that this propagation had different modes. Depending on output variable, the response of model dynamics to uncertainty in inputs ranged from uncertainty in outputs that matched that of inputs to those that were muted or that were biased, as well as uncertainty that was persistent in time after input errors dropped.","MAYBE"

A class of metapopulation models that have been successfully used in practical applications are called stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOMs), which model the presence/absence of the species on habitat patches as a Markov chain. The presence-absence assumption makes the model relatively parameter sparse, facilitates empirical data collection, and enables rigorous parameter estimation.

The state variable (usually density or abundance) may be hidden from view and known only through highly indirect observational schemes (such as public health records, hunting reports, or fossil/archeological surveys). We extend the basic state-space model for time-series analysis to accommodate these dominant sources of variability that influence population data.

We measured the frequency of approaches, and also design and statistical issues, in assessments of harvesting effects on three response variables (tree regeneration, vertebrates and water) in two major native forests of south-east Australia. Our evaluation was based on 124 documents that contain unique, field-based research and that represent the complete written record (published and unpublished) of relevant research prior to mid-2002. 3. The dominant approach was contrasts between manipulated stands, nearly always involving mature and old-growth stands as the reference or control. In studies of tree regeneration, focus on wood-production objectives was apparent in the relatively frequent use of stocking standards, and in the use of between- and within-stand contrasts without a control condition. Comparatively greater use of models in vertebrate and water studies suggested more frequent integration of generic principles and, in water studies, reflected strong collective knowledge based on the repeated use of BACI-type designs (i.e. before-after, control-impact) or long-term data sets. 4. Statistical issues such as poor reporting of experimental designs and of sample statistics were common. Explicit hypotheses were rare, and there was no evidence of definition of critical effect sizes, use of power analysis or use of non-classical statistical approaches (e.g. Bayesian inference). 5. Lack of treatment replication was widespread in between-stand contrasts and less frequent in within-stand contrasts. Inappropriate interpretation of results from non-replicated experimental designs remains an ongoing issue. 6. Synthesis and applications. The amount of information obtainable from stand-level manipulations of forest would substantially increase through greater attention to data quality and experimental protocols.

The goal is to combine prior information, in the form of ecological dynamics and substantive knowledge about uncertain parameters, with available measurements. Posterior estimates of both the time-varying ecological state variables and the model parameters are obtained, along with their uncertainty. Ecological models of interacting populations are considered in the context of a nonlinear, non-Gaussian state space model. This comprises a nonlinear stochastic difference equation for the ecological dynamics, and an observation equation which relates the model state to the measurements. Complex error processes are readily incorporated. The posterior probability density function provides a complete solution to the inverse problem. Bayes' theorem allows one to obtain this posterior density through synthesis of the prior information and the observations. To illustrate this Bayesian inverse method, these ideas are applied to a simple ecosystem box model concerned with predicting the seasonal co-evolution of a population of grazing shellfish and its two food sources: plankton and detritus. Observations of shellfish biomass over time are available. Lognormal system noise was incorporated into the ecosystem equations at all time steps. Ingestion and respiration parameters for shellfish growth are considered as uncertain quantities described by beta distributions. Stochastic simulation was carried out and provided predictions of the model state with uncertainty estimates. The Bayesian inverse method was then used to assimilate the additional information contained in the observations. Posterior probability density functions for the parameters and time-varying ecological state were computed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The ecological dynamics spread the measurement information to all state variables and parameters, even those not directly observed. Probabilistic state estimates are refined in comparison to those from the stochastic simulation.

For the cluster analysis in step I many hard, seemingly arbitrary choices have to be made that nevertheless influence the solution (similarity measure, clustering strategy, number of clusters). The stability of the solution is often of concern, e.g. in clustering by the TWINSPAN program. In the discriminant analysis of step 2 it can occur that a water sample is misclassified on the basis of the environmental data but on further inspection happens to be a borderline case in the cluster analysis. One would then rather reclassify such a sample and iterate the two steps. Bayesian latent class analysis is a flexible, extendable model-based cluster analysis approach that recently has gained popularity in the statistical literature and that has the potential to address these problems. It allows the macrofauna and environmental data to be modelled and analyzed in a single integrated analysis. An exciting extension is to incorporate in the analysis prior information on the habitat preferences of the macrofauna taxa such as is available in lists of indicator values. The output of the analysis is not a hard assignment of water samples to clusters but a probabilistic (fuzzy) assignment. The number of clusters is determined on the basis of the Bayes factor. A standard feature of the Bayesian method is to make predictions and to assess their uncertainty. We applied this approach to a data set consisting of 70 water samples, 484 macrofauna taxa and four environmental variables for which previously a five cluster solution had been proposed. The standard for Bayesian estimation, the Gibbs sampler, worked fine on a subset with only 12 selected taxa but did not converge on the full set with 484 taxa. This is due to many configurations in which the assignment probabilities are all very close to either 0 or 1. This convergence problem is comparable with the local optima problem in classical cluster optimization algorithms, including the EM algorithm used in Latent Gold, a Windows program for latent class analysis. The convergence problem needs to be solved before the benefits of Bayesian latent class analysis can come to fruition in this application. We discuss possible solutions.

Most Bayesian inference requires the numerical approximation of analytically intractable integrals. Two methods based on Monte Carlo simulation have appeared in the ecological/environmental modelling literature, Though they sound similar, the Bayesian Monte Carlo (BMC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are very different in their efficiency and effectiveness in providing useful approximations for accurate inference in Bayesian applications. We compare these two methods using a low-dimensional biochemical oxygen demand decay model as an example. We demonstrate that the BMC is extremely inefficient because the prior parameter distribution, from which the Monte Carlo sample is drawn, is often a poor surrogate for the posterior parameter distribution, particularly if the parameters are highly correlated. In contrast, MCMC generates a chain that converges, in distribution, on the posterior parameter distribution, that can be regarded as a sample from the posterior distribution. The inefficiency of the BMC can lead to marginal posterior parameter distributions that appear irregular and may be highly misleading because the important region of the posterior distribution may never be sampled. We also point out that a priori specification of the model error variance can strongly influence the estimation of the principal model parameters. Although the BMC does not require that the model error variance be specified, most published applications have treated this variance as a known constant. Finally, we note that most published BMC applications have chosen a uniform prior distribution, making the BMC more similar to a likelihood-based inference rather than a Bayesian method because the posterior is unaffected by the prior. Though other prior distributions could be applied, the treatment of Monte Carlo samples with any other choice of prior distribution has not been discussed in the BMC literature.

Researchers are often hampered by a lack of basic biological data, the usual response to which is to develop sustainability indices based on highly simplified population models. However, the standard indices in the bushmeat literature do not perform well under realistic conditions of uncertainty, bias in parameter estimation, and habitat loss. Another possible approach to estimating the sustainability of hunting under uncertainty is to use Bayesian statistics, but this is mathematically demanding. Red listing of threatened species has to be carried out in extremely data-poor situations: uncertainty has been incorporated into this process in a relatively simple and intuitive way using fuzzy numbers. The current methods for estimating sustainability of bushmeat hunting also do not incorporate spatial heterogeneity. No-take areas are one management tool that can address uncertainty in a spatially explicit way.","NO"

Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone.

I contrast Bayesian techniques with traditional hypothesis-testing techniques using examples applicable to conservation. I use a trend analysis of two hypothetical populations to illustrate how easy it is to understand Bayesian results, which are given in terms of probability Bayesian trend analysis indicated that the two populations had very different chances of declining at biologically important rates. For example, the probability that the first population was declining faster than 5% per year was 0.00, compared to a probability of 0.86 for the second population. The Bayesian results appropriately identified which population was of greater conservation concern. The Bayesian results contrast with those obtained with traditional hypothesis testing Hypothesis testing indicated that the first population, which the Bayesian analysis indicated had no chance of declining at >5% per year, was declining significantly because it was declining at a slow rate and the abundance estimates were precise. Despite the high probability that the second population was experiencing a serious decline, hypothesis testing failed to reject the null hypothesis of no decline because the abundance estimates were imprecise. Finally, I extended the trend analysis to illustrate Bayesian decision theory, which allows for choice between more than two decisions and allows explicit specification of the consequences of various errors. The Bayesian results again differed from the traditional results: the decision analysis led to the conclusion that the first population was declining slowly and the second population was declining rapidly.","NO"
"235","Elise","not vetted","Foley, P","Problems in extinction model selection and parameter estimation","ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT","2000",NA,"It is a vexing problem to achieve a consensus about the proper scientific way to assess population viability for habitat conservation plans. Rather than a hypothesis-testing approach, here it is proposed to select population models, estimate extinction parameters, and assess prediction uncertainty using a pragmatic, empirical Bayesian approach. The simplest usable models include the effects of population growth, r; carrying capacity, K; Allee threshold, N-A; and environmental stochasticity, v(r). Analytic predictions of expected extinction times are available for such models. Models that are more complex can be elaborated from this basis. Selection from a hierarchy of nesting population models can often be done through the evaluation of parameters. The estimation of the most important extinction parameters can be undertaken in a variety of ways. Time series can be analyzed to estimate r(d), v(r), rho, and K. Habitat models and individualistic population models may help estimate N, and K and demographic stochasticity. Fine-scale biogeography and climatological data may be useful in the estimation of a variety of parameters. Because it takes many years to estimate extinction parameters accurately for a given population of interest, the most efficient estimation procedures are desirable. I propose the use of prior information from an (as yet nonexistent) population biology database. The accumulation of local information through monitoring will improve our estimates allowing adaptive management. Uncertainty in the estimates will always remain, but it may be quantified by the posterior distributions. A crude example is discussed using treefrog population data. Although the motivations, beliefs, and biases of competing stakeholders will differ, a habitat conservation plan could accommodate this variation in the prior distributions. Field experience from monitoring will increasingly clear up any discrepancies between the opposing beliefs and the real ecosystem. As the world is an uncertain place and because there is no universal scientific method, there will always be controversy and surprises. The best we can do is (1) agree about our prior information, (2) agree about the strategy of model selection and parameter estimation, and (3) agree about our strategy for adaptive management. Perhaps the greatest impediment to such prior agreements for HCPs is the likely paranoia inspired by the use of unfamiliar statistical methodology. We need to train students of ecology in a more flexible and deeper understanding of statistics and philosophy of science.","NO"

Dynamic linear models (DLMs) were used to study time trends in annual average PCB concentrations in five species of Lake Michigan salmonids, using data collected from 1972 to 1994 by both the Michigan and Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources. DLMs use an adaptive fitting procedure to track trends in the rate of decline over time, in contrast to other approaches that fit fixed parameters. We used this method to make forecasts of PCB concentrations in these fishes, along with Bayesian credible-interval estimates associated with these forecasts. Point estimates of PCB concentrations in all five species show a decline through a 10-yr forecast horizon. However, upper bounds on the 90% credible-interval uncertainty estimates for chinook salmon and lake bout indicate that steady or slightly increasing annual average PCB concentrations are within the 90% credible interval for the IO-yr forecast horizon. DLM forecasts corroborate other modeling results for Lake Michigan salmonids that suggest that PCBs will decline very slowly over the next decade.","NO"

The second used a point database of surveyed botanical composition to define relationships between the species location and climatic factors. Agreement between the zones defined by knowledge-based logical modelling, inductive modelling from points and interpolation of botanical composition was generally good. Botanical composition was used as an abundance measure to enhance estimates of conditional probability of presence in inductive modelling. Additional peaks in the distribution of conditional probability of presence with certain climate variables allowed the identification of a sub-zone attributable to F. campestris which was smaller than that produced by logical modelling. Modelled zones from both methods agreed with published descriptions of distribution and intergrading between species.

The density function describes the joint probabilities of the following parameters: the anaerobic dechlorination rate constant, the volatilization rate constant, the aerobic biodegradation rate constant, the sedimentation rate, and the contaminated sediment depth. Difficulties in forming this probability density function are shown to result from problems with extrapolating data from the laboratory to the field, non-stationarity and aggregation, extrapolating information and analyses from other sites, and bias due to study design, These difficulties result in a density function characterized by high variances, and imply that predictions from this simulation model, and similarly large fate-and-transport models, are apt to be highly uncertain.

Consequently, our null hypotheses do not often take into account pre-existing data and do not require parameterization, our experiments demand large sample sizes, and we rarely use results from one experiment to predict the outcomes of future experiments. Comparative statistical statements such as ''we reject the null hypothesis st the 0.05 level,'' which reflect the likelihood of our data given our hypothesis, are of little use in communicating our results to nonspecialists or in describing the degree of certitude we have in our conclusions. In contrast, Bayesian statistical inference requires the explicit assignment of prior probabilities, based on existing information, to the outcomes of experiments. Such an assignment forces the parameterization of null and alternative hypotheses. The results of these experiments, regardless of sample size, then can be used to compute posterior probabilities of our hypotheses given the available data. Inferential conclusions in a Bayesian mode also are mon meaningful in environmental policy discussions: e.g., ''our experiments indicate that there is a 95% probability that acid deposition will affect northeastern conifer forests.'' Based on comparisons with current statistical practice in ecology, I argue that a ''Bayesian ecology'' would (a) make better use of pre-existing data; (b) allow stronger conclusions to be drawn from large-scale experiments with few replicates; and (c) be more relevant to environmental decision-making.","YES"

The method draws upon Bayesian Statistics as the main inference engine, as outlined by Box and Draper (1965), M.J. Box (1971) and Box and Tiao (1973/1992). The Bayesian approach allows the calculation of the uncertainty of parameters and predictions both before and after the model is confronted with data. There are several modelling objectives that can be dealt with through this technique in a unifying way: calibration of parameters, on the basis of prior knowledge and the available data; estimation of parameter uncertainty and correlation structure; estimation of predictive uncertainty for the assessment of trends and scenario analyses; validation of model structure in relation to residual errors. Moreover the method allows an iterative approach between hypothesis generation and data analysis. The method is applied to perform a regression and uncertainty analysis of the model PCLake on data from an 18-lake Dutch survey. PCLake is a dynamic nutrient-ecosystem model with a closed nutrient budget, comprising one water and one sediment layer. The model was run until steady state was reached and results were compared to summer-averaged field data from the survey. The output variables selected are chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus concentrations. The analysis was done for three selected parameters, considered uniformly distributed within predefined ranges. Posterior distributions were calculated for each lake on the basis of 125 three-parameter combinations. The residual error of the prediction of chlorophyll-a was reduced from a factor of 3.8 on the basis of the prior uncertainty analysis down to a factor of 2.3 after regression on both variables. For total P concentrations these factors were 1.4 before regression and 1.5 afterwards, hence a small trade-off to match chlorophyll levels. The prior uncertainty factor of mean chlorophyll predictions was reduced from 1.9 before regression to 1.1 after regression on both outputs, while for mean total P predictions these factors were 1.1 and 1.05, respectively. The conclusion can be drawn that chlorophyll-a is particularly sensitive to the three parameters, while total P is determined to a large extent by the lake-specific input parameters. The posterior parameter distributions reflected these differences in sensitivity. Painwise correlations between parameters were low. Analysis of systematic and case-specific deviations between model regression and data helps to identify other critical parameters and possible structural modifications.","NO"

As a result, prediction of individual lake response reflects behavior among lakes, increasing prediction error by the among-lake variance. Alternatively, a random coefficient model may be applied to the same cross-sectional data set to yield lake-specific parameters as opposed to a single set of global parameters. The random coefficients are based on classical estimators that reflect both global behavior and lake-specific response. Under normality, known variance, and a noninformative prior, the mean of the posterior Bayesian distribution on the lake-specific parameters is equivalent to the estimated random coefficients. In this study, the random coefficient model was applied to a cross-sectional data set on chlorophyll a, nitrogen, and phosphorus in North Carolina lakes. Both global and lake-specific parameters were estimated for these data. A second data set representing different years of observations for the same lakes was used to compare the two modeling approaches on the basis of prediction variance; the result was a 12.7% reduction in mean squared prediction error for the random coefficient model. Other applications of the random coefficient model in empirical and mechanistic modeling are suggested in a concluding discussion.","NO"

BMC also provides estimates of parameter uncertainty as a function of observed data on model state variables. The use of Bayesian inference generates uncertainty estimates that combine prior information on parameter uncertainty with observed variation in water quality data to provide an improved estimate of model parameter and output uncertainty. It also combines Monte Carlo analysis with Bayesian inference to determine the ability of random selected parameter sets to simulate observed data. BMC expands upon previous studies by providing a quantitative estimate of parameter acceptabilty using the statistical likelihood function. The likelihood of each parameter set is employed to generate an n-dimensional hypercube describing a probability distribution of each parameter and the covariance among parameters. These distributions are utilized to estimate uncertainty in model predictions. Application of BMC to a dissolved oxygen model reduced the estimated uncertainty in model output by 72% compared with standard Monte Carlo techniques. Sixty percent of this reduction was directly attributed to consideration of covariance between model parameters. A significant benefit of the technique is the ability to compare the reduction in total model output uncertainty corresponding to: (1) collection of more data on model state variables, and (2) laboratory or field studies to better define model processes. Limitations of the technique include computational requirements and accurate estimation of the joint probability distribution of model errors.
